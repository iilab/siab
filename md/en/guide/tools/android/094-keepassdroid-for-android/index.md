# What you will get from this guide

- The ability to save all your passwords in one convenient and secure database.
- The ability to create and store many strong passwords without having to remember them.
- The ability to share your KeePass password database files between your mobile device and computer.

# 1. Introduction to KeePassDroid

**KeePassDroid** is an easy-to-use tool that helps you store and manage all your passwords in a highly secure database. You can copy your existing KeePass database file from your computer to the **KeePassDroid** application on the mobile device (or other way around: from the mobile device to your computer).

**Note**: Before copying your password database to a mobile device and opening it, consider that security and the protection of the mobile device may not match the security on your computer and your password database may be more at risk. Instead of copying the database from your computer, you could create a unique database for your device which will only have the passwords you need on it. 

The database is protected by a 'master password' that you create. This password is also used to encrypt the entire contents of the database. You can store your existing passwords in **KeePassDroid** or have it generate one for you. **KeePassDroid** does not require any prior configuration or specific installation instructions. It's ready to go when you are!

By using **KeePassDroid** all the time, you never actually have to see or know what your password is. The copy/paste functions take care of moving it from the database to the required window. For example, if you use KeePassDroid's *Random Generator* to create a password for a new account, you will be using a strong password that you would never have to remember!

Congratulations! You have successfully created your secure password database. Now you can use it to safely store all your current and future passwords.

**Note**: If you use KeePass on another mobile device or computer, you can copy its database to your device and then open it with **KeePassDroid** or **KeePass**.


# 3. Use KeePassDroid to manage your passwords





## 3.1 Add a group

**KeePassDroid** stores passwords entries in groups to keep your information organized, the default groups are **Email** and **Internet**, but you can create your own group by **tapping** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-009.png), typing the name of the group and then ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-010.png).

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-011.png) ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-012.png)

*Figures 7 and 8: Adding a new group*

**Tap** your newly created group to open it and begin adding password entries.


## 3.2 Add a password entry

The **Add entry** screen lets you add account information, passwords and other important details into your newly-created database. 

**Step 1**. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-013.png) to activate the *Add Entry* screen as follows:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-014.png)

*Figures 9: Adding a new password entry*

**Note**: The *Add Entry* screen presents you with a number of fields to be completed. None of these fields are mandatory; information submitted here is largely for your own convenience. Filling them in may prove useful in situations where you are searching for a particular entry.

A brief explanation of these different text boxes is presented as follows:

  - **Name**: A name to describe the particular password entry. For example, your *twitter* account.

  - **Username**: The user name associated with the password entry. For example, *TherobotONO*.

  - **URL**: The internet site associated with the password entry. For example, *https://twitter.com*.

  - **Password**: The password for your account. This section also allows you to [*generate a random password*](#1041) if you do not want to come up with one your self.

  - **Confirm passwords**: The confirmation of the password.

  - **Comments**: This is where you type in descriptive or general information about the account or site for which you are storing information. For example: Mail server settings: *POP3 SSL, pop.gmail.com, Port 995; SMTP TLS, smtp.gmail.com, Port: 465*.

**Note**: Creating or modifying the password entries in **KeePassDroid** does not update your account password! Think of **KeePassDroid** as a secure electronic address book for your passwords. It only stores what you write in it, nothing more.

**Step 2**. **Tap** **save** to save your changes.

Your new entry now appears in the group.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-015.png)

*Figure 11: New entry appearing in the newly-created group*


## 3.3. Copy a KeePassDroid password

Given that a secure password is not easily memorized, **KeePassDroid** lets you copy it from the database and paste it onto whatever account or website requires it.

**Step 1**. Open the password entry you wish to use and **tap** the menu icon (![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-016.png)):

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-017.png)

*Figure 12: Password options*

**Step 2**. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-018.png).

**Step 3**. **Open** the related account or site and **paste** the password by **tapping** and holding on the appropriate field and selecting *Paste*:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-019.png)

*Figure 13: Text edition options*

## 3.4 Edit an entry

You can change your password or modify other details stored in the entry. It is generally considered good security practice to change a password every three to six months.

**Step 1**. **Tap** the *Group* that contains the entry you wish to edit and then **tap** the entry to view its contents.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-020.png)

*Figure 1: Entry Contents*

**Step 2**. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-021.png) to start editing the information. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-023.png)

*Figure 2: Edit information*

**Step 3**. When you have finished, **tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-022.png) to save all changes.


## 3.5 Generate a random password

Long, randomly-generated passwords are strong and secure as their generation is based on mathematical principles and cannot be simply guessed by someone who is trying to break into one of your accounts. **KeePassDroid** supplies a *Password Generator*, to help you with this process. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-024.png)

*Figure 3: Edit password entry screen*

**Step 1**. **Tap** the button ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-025.png) from within either the *Add Entry* or *Edit Entry* screen (Fig. 3 above), to activate the *Password Generator* screen as follows:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-026.png)

*Figure 4: Password Generator*

The *Password Generator* screen automatically gives you a random, short 8-character password. However, we recommend that you use a longer password. You generate a longer, more secure password by selecting the following options as in our example: 


- **Length** at least 16-characters
- **Check** Upper-case Letter
- **Check** Lower-case Letter
- **Check** Digits
- **Check** Minus
- **Check** Underline 
- **Check** Brackets

**Note:** To generate passwords longer than 16-characters, replace the number in the field with your desired figure. 

See Fig. 4 above.

**Step 2**. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-027.png) to have **KeePassDroid** generate a new random password.

**Step 3**. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-028.png) to copy the generated password into your account entry and bring you back to the edit screen.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-029.png)

*Figure 5: Entry information*

**Step 4**. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-030.png) to accept the password and return to the *Entry* screen as follows:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-031.png)

*Figure 6: Entry screen*

## 3.6 Lock your password database

**Step 1**. **Tap** on the **Lock icon** (![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-032.png)) which is at the top of the main screens while **KeePassDroid** is open. This will instantly lock your database. You will be presented with the following screen requiring you to enter your *master password* to unlock.

# 4. Manage your password database





## 4.1 Create a backup of your password database

The **KeePassDroid** database file on your Android device is denoted by its *.kdb* file extension. You can copy this file to your computer or your USB memory stick. No one else will be able to open the database without the master password.

By default, the database is stored in a folder named *keepass* on your phone. The exact location is */mnt/sdcard/keepass*.

**Note**: You need to have KeePass installed on your computer, or a portable version of KeePass located on your USB memory stick, to be able to open your database which you copied from your Android device. 

Please see [**KeePass chapter**](../keepass/windows) for more information.

## 4.2 Reset your master password

You can change the Master Password at any time. This can be done once you have opened the password database.

**Step 1**. **tap** the menu icon (![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-016.png)) found on the top right of the main screens. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-034.png)

*Figure 8: Menu options*

**Step 2**. **Tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-035.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-036.png)

*Figure 9: Enter a new password*

**Step 3**. Type in your new master password in the **Password** and the **Confirm Password** fields, Then **tap** OK.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-037.png)

*Figure 10: Enter a new password*


## 4.3 Change your clipboard timeout

For greater security, the password is copied to the clipboard for a limited duration before it is automatically cleared from the clipboard. You have the option to change this duration to **30 seconds**, **1 minute** or **5 minutes**.

There is also an option **Never** but we recommend that you do not select this.

You can see these options in the following screen by going to: **Menu** (![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-016.png)) > **Settings** > **Application** > **Clipboard timeout**

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-038.png)

*Figure 11: Clipboard timeout options*


## 4.4 Set your database lock timeout

You also have the option to lock your database when the application is inactive for a specific time. Your database will automatically lock after 5 minutes of not being used. If you wish to shorten this, **tap**: **Menu** (![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-016.png)) > **Settings** > **Application** > **Application timeout**.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/keepassdroid-and-039.png)

*Figure 12: Application timeout options*

**Select** **30 seconds**, **1 minute** or, the default **5 minutes**. As before, there is an option to **Never** timeout, but we recommend against using this.

# FAQ

***Q***: *On the outside chance that I forget my master password, is there anything I can do to access **KeePassDroid** and retrieve my password databases?*

***A***: *No. There is nothing you can do in that situation. On the bright side, at least no one else will be able to access your password database! To prevent this from happening, you could use some of the methods for remembering a password that are described in the How-to Booklet chapter [**How to create and maintain good passwords**](../passwords).*

***Q***: *And if I uninstall **KeePassDroid**, what will happen to my passwords?*

***A***: *The program will be deleted from your computer; however, your database (stored in a .kdb file) will remain. You can open this file at any time in the future if you install **KeePassDroid** again.*

***Q***: *I think I accidentally deleted the database file!*

***A***: *Hopefully, you made a backup beforehand. Also, make sure you haven't simply forgotten where you stored the file in the first place. Search your computer for a file with a .kdb extension. If you really have deleted it, take a look at the Hands-on guide to [**Recuva**](../recuva/windows). It could help you to recover the file.*
