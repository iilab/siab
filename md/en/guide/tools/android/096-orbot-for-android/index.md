# 1. Introduction to Orbot

Orbot provides Android devices with access to the [*Tor Network*](/en/glossary#Tor). Form more information see [**Tor - Digital Anonymity and Circumvention**](../torbrowser/windows).


# 2. Install and configure Orbot





## 2.1 Install Orbot

*Figure 1: Orbot in the Google Play store*

**Note:** **Orbot** can also be downloaded [directly](https://guardianproject.info/releases/orbot-latest.apk) or from the third party [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=orbot&fdid=org.torproject.android) and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/The-Guardian-Project-Orbot-Proxy/dp/B00E7TIFGQ) stores.

**Step 2:**. Before the installation process begins, you will be prompted to review the access the application will have on your phone. Review this carefully.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-005.png)

*Figure 3: Choose language*

**Step 3:** A configuration wizard will appear with a description of Orbot. **Read** it and **tap** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-006.png.

*Figure 5: Important warning about how to use Orbot*

**Step 5:** A screen will appear asking you to grant **Orbot** *Superuser access*. *Superuser access* requires that your device is [rooted](/en/glossary#root) if you want to make use of **Orbot's** Transparent Proxy features - we will not explore this feature in the **Orbot** guide.

If your smartphone is not rooted, just **tick** the option that states *I understand and would like to continue without Superuser*. The next screen explains in order for you to benefit from Tor, you will need to use apps built to work with **Orbot**, or that support HTTP or SOCKS proxy.

*Figures 13 and 14: Orbot finishes connecting*

**Note:** You will only see the notification screen (Fig. 3) the first time you start **Orbot** after installation.

**Step 3:** To disconnect **Orbot** you **touch and hold** the green **Orbot** until it turns grey.  Or if you want to disconnect and quit **Orbot**, **tap** the menu icon (![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-019.png)) in the top right of the screen and select ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/orbot-and-020.png) .

*Figures 15: Exiting Orbot*

In order to browse or chat on the internet anonymously, you need to install an app (browser or chat) which can route your communication through a proxy in conjunction with **Orbot**. Please read the related *Hands-on Guides* for using [**Orweb**](../orweb/android) and [**ChatSecure**](../chatsecure/android) with **Orbot**.

**Step 4:** If at any stage you want to appear to come from a new location, you can get a *new identity* from **Orbot** by **swiping** *left* or *right* on the green **Orbot** image.  The image will briefly spin and then display *You've switched to a new Tor Identity*.
