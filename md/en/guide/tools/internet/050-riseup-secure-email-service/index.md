# What you will get from this guide

# 1. Introduction to RiseUp





## 1.0 Other tools like RiseUp

Although **RiseUp** is a secure email service managed by trustworthy advocates of Internet privacy and security, an unusual email service may attract unwarranted attention. It might make more sense in some situations, to blend in by using a popular email service in your country. The goal is to make this decision without compromising your minimum security requirements. We offer the following points for consideration when choosing an email service:

1. Does it permit the **use of encrypted channels** (like *https*, and other SSL encrypted versions of protocols like IMAPs, POP3s, SMTPs) for transferring all information (including login-in information, and your emails), and are there any encryption-related problems (for example, problems related to encryption certificates)?

2. Are the **email servers managed in secure way?** Are they run by professionals who are committed to using the best practices for protecting your information? Do you trust they will *not* provide access to your information, for *any* reason (commercial, political, religious, etc.), to third parties?

3. Do you know the geographical location of the servers, **under which territorial jurisdiction they fall** or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information?

In some parts of the world, **Google Mail** would prove a good alternative to **RiseUp**,  offering a better "blending in" effect, without compromising much of the security (given its commercial nature).


## 1.1 Things you should know about RiseUp before you start

**RiseUp** is a collective dedicated to providing private and secure hosting, listing and mail services for individuals and organisations who are committed to political and social justice. As their services are free and Riseup is not monitoring your activity, your email account is much smaller than other advertisement-driven and non-secure providers. A new account can only be registered by those who have received an invite code from two existing members. Read [more about Riseup on their website](https://help.riseup.net/en/about-us).

**RiseUp** operates exclusively over the **Secure Sockets Layer** (**SSL**), providing a secure connection between your computer and their server. This security is maintained when reading your email in a client program, over secure **POP**, **IMAP** and **SMTP** connections (these refer to protocols used by a email client program to download or send your emails). **RiseUp** is compatible with **Mozilla Thunderbird**. To learn how to set up **Mozilla Thunderbird** to access your **RiseUp** email account, please refer to the chapter on [**Thunderbird**](../thunderbird/windows).

In addition to email accounts **RiseUp** also provides: 

- [**Mailing Lists**](https://lists.riseup.net/) for email group communication;
- [**CrabGrass**](https://crabgrass.riseup.net/) its own free and open source social networking application, designed for group and network organizing and tailored to the needs of the global justice movement;
- [**EtherPad**](https://pad.riseup.net/) collaborative document editing platform, where multiple users can edit the same document at the same time;
- [**OpenVPN**](https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn) an encrypted Internet proxy, which allows browsing the Internet through **RiseUp** servers. For more information about proxies refer to chapter [8. How to remain anonymous and bypass censorship on the Internet](../anonymity-and-circumvention);
- [**Jabber/XMPP**](https://help.riseup.net/en/chat) instant messaging, text, voice and video chat server. You can make use of this server with programs such as [Jitsi](../jitsi/windows), [Pidgin](../pidgin/windows), Adium, and ChatSecure among others. Also refer to section [Securing other Internet communication tools](../secure-communication/#501) or the chapter [How to keep your Internet communication private](../secure-communication).


# 2. Create a RiseUp Account

**RiseUp** offers you two different methods for registering an email account. Each method requires a differentall investment of effort and time. 

1). Directly request an account from the **RiseUp** team themselves. Bear in mind that **RiseUp** generally runs on donations and the enthusiasm and goodwill of its volunteers - this method can take longer to be approved for an account.  

2). The recommended method is for individuals and/or organisations to be invited to join by two existing **RiseUp** account members. This method requires that each existing **RiseUp** member sends you an invite code. To see how such codes are generated, please refer to [**Section 4.3 The Invites Page**](../riseup/internet#706) 

After you have received your invite codes, perform the following steps to register your free **RiseUp** account as follows: 

**Step 1**. **Type** [**https://mail.riseup.net**](https://mail.riseup.net) into your web browser, to activate the **RiseUp** site as follows:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-01.png)

*Figure 1: The https://mail.riseup.net/ page*

**Note**: The ***s*** in the *http**s**://* address indicates that you are now communicating through a **Secure Sockets Layer** (**SSL**) connection. 

For more information about this, please refer to the **How-to Booklet** chapter on [**Keeping your Internet Communication Private**](../secure-communication) or to [**https://help.riseup.net/security**](https://help.riseup.net/security).

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-03.png) to activate the *Request account* page as follows:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-04.png)

*Figure 2: The RiseUp Request an email account page*

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-05.png) to display the **RiseUp** *Request an email account - About our email service* page.

**Important**: You *must* agree to all terms and conditions stated on the *About our email service* page to proceed with the **RiseUp** account setup. 

**Step 4**. Read the **RiseUp** *Social Contract*, *Privacy Policy* and *Terms of Service*. **Click** all the *I accept riseup.net's* check boxes to confirm that you agree to the terms and conditions.  

**Step 5**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-05.png) to begin creating your **RiseUp** account by filling out the following on-line forms: *Account information*, *Password* and *Activation*.

**Step 6**. **Enter** a desired username for your account. This will become your login and your email address. (In this tutorial, we based our example on 'ssayyed' to generate an email account known as [**ssayyed@riseup.net**](mailto:ssayyed@riseup.net). 

**Important**: Do not use commas, full stops or spaces in the username. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-06.png)

*Figure 3: An example of a completed Account information form*

**Note** that the fields *Alternate email*, *Language*, *Country* and *Time Zone* are not changed or they are left empty, to minimise the amount of personal information that you store on the server. Leaving *Alternate email* field empty will provide better privacy, but will not let you reset your password for this account in case you forget it.

**Step 7**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-05.png) to proceed to the *Password* form. 

**Note**: If you chosen username is already taken, you will be prompted to create a different one.

**Step 8**. **Fill-in** the *Password* and *Retype password* fields and **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-05.png) to proceed.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-07.png)

*Figure 4: The completed Password form*

**Important:** The password for your **RiseUp** account is the most important factor in the security of your account. To learn how to create a strong password, please refer to the How-to Booklet chapter [**How to Create and Maintain Good Passwords**](../passwords) and to the manual on [**KeePass**](../keepass/windows).

**Step 9**.  Complete the *Activation* form.

If you have received Invite codes from **RiseUp** account users that you know personally, **type** the Invite codes into their respective fields. Each Invite code much come from a different user. Alternatively you can request an account by **RiseUp.net** by completing the *Tell us about yourself* field. If you provide Invite codes, do not fill in the *Tell us about yourself* field.
 
**Type** the *Invite codes* into their respective text fields.

**Step 1**. **Open** the **RiseUp** home page in SSL mode as follows: [**https://mail.riseup.net/**](https://mail.riseup.net/)

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-11.png)

*Figure 1: The RiseUp mail login page*

**Riseup** is currently using [Roundcube](http://roundcube.net/), a free and open source web mail interface. Roundcube require JavaScript.

Riseup web mail also need your browser to accept cookies (see [Firefox chapter](../firefox/windows) for more information about cookies).

The **RiseUp** web mail login page is divided into the login section in the centre, and a group of links below it:

- [Old webmail (squirrelmail only)](https://mail.riseup.net/sm/src/login.php): alternative, simple and lightweight web mail interface that does not need JavaScript;

## 3.1 Login With the Virtual Keyboard

If you are using a public or shared computer (for example in an Internet café, community centre or library), you can enter your password by using the **virtual keyboard**. It offers your email account another layer of protection from *key-logger* programs. Key-logger programs are designed to monitor user's physical key strokes to record passwords, usernames and other vital information. Virtual keyboard allow users to circumvent this security vulnerability, by letting the user enter their password using the mouse. 

To use the **RiseUp** *virtual keyboard*, perform the following steps: 

**Step 1**. **Open** the **RiseUp** home page [**https://mail.riseup.net/**](https://mail.riseup.net/).

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-18.png) to activate virtual keyboard as follows:

## 4.0 Change Your Account Settings

**RiseUp** lets you modify different settings for your account. You can specify the size of your email box, change your account name and address, add aliases and much more. You can also
create invite codes to help your friends and colleagues register their own **RiseUp** account. 

**Step 1**. **Open** the **RiseUp** *Account Settings* page as follows: [**https://user.riseup.net/**](https://user.riseup.net/)

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-21.png)

*Figure 1: The user.riseup.net page*

**Step 2**. **Type** in your username and password into their corresponding text fields.

*Figure 2: The riseup.net user control page*

<a name="4.1"></a>

## 4.1 The My Settings page

The *My Settings* page displays all the information that you originally entered in the [**Create a RiseUp Account**](#698) page. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-24.png) to open the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-25.png)

*Figure 3: The Settings page*

You can change your username on this screen, which will also change your email address. The new username should also be unique. Here you may also change any other account details such as the alternate email, password and so on. 

**Note** that the fields *Language*, *Country* and *Time Zone* should not be changed to minimise amount of personal information that you store on the server.

**Step 2**. **Type** in your new information, then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-26.png) to display this message:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-27.png)

*Figure 4: Successfully updated your changes*

<a name="4.2"></a>

## 4.2 The Email settings page

The *Email settings* page lets you modify or view information related to email storage. You can even set the 'quota' or amount of space reserved for your email account on a **RiseUp** server. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-28.png) to open the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-29.png)

*Figure 5: The Email settings page*

**Step 2**. **Enter** an appropriate number into the *Quota* text field. 

**Note**: Your account is limited in size to a maximum of your disk quota (by default it is 92 MB at this moment). If you need more space, consider downloading your email using a mail client like Thunderbird, and do not keep them on the server.

You may also create aliases for your account on this page. An alias is like a nickname for your account. Whilst the main account will remain as before, people will be able to send email to your alias address as well. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-30.png)

*Figure 6: The Aliases section of the Email settings page*

*Example*: **ssayyedd@riseup.net** account now has two aliases. Email sent to **safeandsecure@riseup.net** and **salsaytest@riseup.net** will be forwarded to the main account. This maybe a useful practice to keep your real account address private.

**Note** There are other configuration settings available on this page which you access from the tabs and links as shown on figure 5. Some of them are:

* *Spam settings* : Allows you to configure how a RiseUp server will manage suspected spam (unwanted emails);
* *Mail filters* : Allows you to configure a RiseUp server to sort your incoming emails into different folders or delete specific emails;
* *Fix mailbox* : Can help in a situation where your mailbox stops working; 
* *Restore mail from backups* : Can restore your mailbox content from a backup stored on a RiseUp server;
* *Destroy mailbox* : Will remove your mailbox completely, along with all emails in all folders. You will be able to log in to this account again and create an new (empty) mailbox.


**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/riseup-all-26.png) to save your new settings. 

<a name="4.3"></a>

## 4.3 The Invites page

The *Invites* page lets you generate *invite codes* that are used to invite your friends and colleagues to join **RiseUp**.

# FAQ

***Q***: I cannot log in to my Riseup account.

***A***: Please see the [Troubleshooting webmail login](https://help.riseup.net/en/email/webmail#troubleshooting-webmail-login) in [Riseup Email Help](https://help.riseup.net/email). Also see [Riseup Help: Frequently asked questions](https://help.riseup.net/en/email#frequently-asked-questions-faq) for many other topics.

***Q***: In which circumstances would I use the default (Roundcube) as opposed to the SquirrelMail web email interface?

***A***: If for some reason, one email interface is down or has to undergo routine maintenance, you can always continue working on the other email interface without interruption. Also, the **SquirrelMail** service does not require JavaScript.

***Q***: When creating my account I am uncomfortable giving information about my self, do I have to supply this.

***A***: No, you are not required to supply any personal information unless you want to.

***Q***: How can I create an email account for an activist that I know?

***A***: You need to know another **Riseup** user and must each [generate an invite code](../riseup/internet#703) to send to your colleague. He or she will use these two codes when creating a **Riseup** account.

***Q***: I noticed the two-factor authentication setting in the Roundcube web mail interface, should I use it?

***A***:  Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of protection to your email account by requiring the entry of a random, changing code in addition to your password when login in. However at this time even if you set it up and activate you can still access your emails without a need to use two-factor authentication with **SquirrelMail** web mail interface or with an email client (like Thunderbird) over POP/IMAP access. We are looking forward to further development of the two-factor authentication support on **Riseup**.
