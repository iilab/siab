# 1. Introduction to Spybot





## 1.0 Other tools like Spybot

To protect operating systems like **GNU Linux** and **Mac OS**, we recommend that you: 

**1)** regularly update your operating system, and all the programs installed upon it; 
**2)** use anti-virus program listed in the [*Avast*](../avast/windows) guide; 
**3)** use a firewall program listed in the [*Comodo*](../comodo/windows) guide;  
**4)** use a secure browser like [*Firefox*](../firefox/windows) with the [*NoScript*](../firefox/windows#801) add-on to prevent downloaded scripts from starting up. 

These preventive measures are important to keep your **GNU Linux** or **Mac OS** computer protected.

The spyware and malware protection for computers running **Microsoft Windows** is a very important issue. There are thousands of new malware being created every day. Attack methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The preventive measures outlined in the previous paragraph are **mandatory** for all computers running **Microsoft Windows**. In addition, we strongly recommend the usage of **Spybot** as described in this chapter. 

However, if your computer gets infected despite these precautions, and you find yourself requiring additional Microsoft Windows tools, we recommend the following:

- Install [**SuperAntiSpyware**](http://superantispyware.com), update the spyware definitions, and then scan your computer;
- Install [**Malwarebytes Anti-Malware**](http://www.malwarebytes.org/), perform a *Quick Scan* and then a *Scan* when it finishes running, remove any detected malware displayed in *Show Results*;
- Use other free anti-spyware programs like:  **Microsoft [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-defender) [Defender](http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/windows-defender.aspx)**, [**Ad-Aware Internet Security**](http://www.lavasoft.com/) or [**SpywareBlaster**](http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareblaster.html).


## 1.1 Things you should know about Spybot before you start

**Spybot S&D** is a popular free program used to detect and remove different kinds of adware, malware and spyware from your computer system. It also lets you immunise your system against adware, malware and spyware, preventing them from infecting your computer once **Spybot** is installed. 

**Spybot S&D** is not an anti-virus tool. It can however run along side anti-virus software to enhance security of your PC.   

Adware is any software which displays advertising material on your computer. Certain kinds of adware function remarkably like spyware and can be invasive of your privacy and security. 

Malware (e.g. trojans and worms) is any kind of program designed to harm or hijack the operation of your computer without your consent or knowledge. 

Spyware is any kind of program that collects data, observes and records your private information and tracks your Internet habits. Like malware, it frequently runs on your computer secretly. As such, installing a program like **Spybot** will help you to protect your system and yourself. 

**Note**: **Windows Vista, 7 and 8** have a built-in anti-spyware program called **Windows Defender**. However, it seems to allow **Spybot** to work without any conflict.

# 2. How to Install and Use Spybot

Once **Spybot** is installed, you can use it to identify and remove spyware by following three basic steps: 

1. Updating the *Detection Rules* and *Immunization databases* with the most recent updates from **Spybot**.
2. Immunising your system based on up-to-date immunisation databases.
3. Scanning for threats. This involves checking your system for spyware infestations, based on up-to-date detection rules, and removing them.

**Note**: For a brief overview of key advanced options, please refer to the [**Advanced Options**](#449) section.

You may **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_30.png) to reverse the immunisation process and restore your system to its previous state.


## 2.5 How to Scan for Threats

**Reminder**: Before you begin checking for potential threats, please run the **Spybot** *Updater*. 

To check for potential threats, follow these steps: 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_14.png) to launch the **Spybot** *Start Center*

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_37.png) to activate the screen below:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_38.png)

*Figure 18: System Scan (Spybot - Search & Destroy)*


**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_40.png) to begin scanning your system. *Note - If you have a lot of data, files, programmes etc. this could take 20 minutes to an hour* 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_39.png)

*Figure 19: System Scan (Spybot - Search & Destroy)*

After the scan has been completed, the number and kinds of potential malware found will be listed as shown below:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_41.png)

*Figure 20: Scan for malware displaying potential malware* 

**Step 4**. **Select** the file and review the *Details* box on the left of the screen for each potential threat found to determine if the malware is a genuine threat. 

**Remember** - a *false positive* means that a harmless file, folder, program or registry key could be categorised as malware. Deleting such could cause an issue an issue to another program.


![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_42.png)

*Figure 21: Scan for malware - Details* 

**Tip**: The *Threat Level* is displayed by a colour indicator bar. An *Estimated Danger* rating of *Marginal* or *Very Low* will display as green. As the *Threat Level* moves from *Medium* to *High*, the colour indicator will change from orange to red. At a glance, it will be easy to gauge the potential threat. For example, most Browsers used *Tracking Cookies* when you visit a website. If the information they store is not excessive, the *Estimated Danger* rating my be *Marginal* or *Very Low*. You may choose to keep the cookies for certain websites for convenience. 

**Step 5**. If you choose to delete a file or files **select** the file and **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_44.png) 

You can also choose to to scan individual files and folders using the **File Scan** option in the *Start Center* - the process is similar to the **System Scan** described above. 

**Note**: It is generally a good idea to scan your system for problems every week. 


## 2.6 How to Disable Tracking Cookies

A *tracking Cookie* is a small file saved on your computer by an Internet browser when you visit a website. A cookie can store information that can identify you to a particular website. This can include information such as username, password, personal data used to fill online forms, browsing habits etc. While Cookies provide convenience when browsing, this poses a risk to your anonymity online. 

*Spybot Search & Destroy* allows you to disable *tracking cookies* in all installed browsers from one central location.

Disable *tracking cookies* using the following steps: 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_37.png) to launch the following screen:

## 2.7 How to Use the Recovery tool

The *Quarantine* tool allows you to recover or retrieve any previously deleted or repaired item. This is possible because **Spybot** will create a backup for every item it has previously deleted. If a deleted file causes your computer to malfunction, it is possible to restore it using the *Quarantine* tool. 

To recover a previously deleted item, perform the following steps: 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_45.png) from the *Start Center* to launch the screen below :

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_46.png)

*Figure 25: Quarantine (Spybot - Search & Destroy)* 

**Step 2**. **Check** the items you would like to recover from the list of previously deleted items, and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_47.png).

**Step 3**. Alternatively, **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_48.png) to remove checked files completely. However, be aware that purged items are not recoverable.


# 3. How to Use Spybot in Advanced Mode

**Spybot** has *Default* and *Advanced* sections. The *Advanced Mode* lets you configure settings and perform additional tasks.

## 3.1 How to Enable Advanced Mode

**Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_16.png) in the *Start Center* window to display the *Advanced Tools* and *Professional Tools* options.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_15a.png)

*Figure 1: Advanced Tools*

The free version of *Spybot* only allows you to use some of the options available in the *Advanced Tools* and *Professional Tools* sections:

- **Report Creator** can be used to assist *Spybot* Technical Support teams in the event that you need help with *Spybot* software. The level of support available will usually depend on the version of software you are running - paid verse free  for example. While support forums are a useful source of knowledge to help decide if a file is harmful or not, we do recommend caution before submitting any files or logs from your computer if anonymity is a concern for you.

- **Settings** section lets you configure Language, Scope of scanning, Browsers Spybot-S&D will scan, etc..

- **Startup Tools** section lets you review in details processes active on your computer, programs that are run when your computer is starting, your system scheduled tasks, plugins, system services, installed programs, etc..

- **Rootkit Scan** section checks your computer operating system for presence of *rootkits*, malicious programs that hide at the system level, which makes them undetectable by standard anti-malware tools.


## 3.2 Advanced Mode - Rootkit Scan

The **Rootkit Scan** can be used to flag suspicious files and registry entries for further analysis or for removing them. The steps below will show how to perform a *Rootkit Scan*.

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_61.png) from the *Advanced Tools* pane to activate the window below. Note *Quick scan test results*. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_57.png)

*Figure 5: Rootkit Scan*

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_58.png).

**Step 3**. **Select** the drives and registry entries you wish to scan. We recommend selecting all of the items available. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_04.png). *Note* this scan can take long time (perhaps about an hour) to complete.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_59.png)

*Figure 6: Rootkit Scan - select drives*

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_60.png)

*Figure 7: Rootkit Scan in progress*

When the scan has completed, *Search for rootkits* will display any suspicious files found. You can then review the findings and options to determine if the file is legitimate.  

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_62.png)

*Figure 7: Search for rootkits*

**Step 4**. **Right click** any found items to display the options:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_63.png)

*Figure 8: rootkits scan options*

**Step 5**. **Select** *Show properties* to display details.

**Step 6**. **Select** *Scan file for malware* if this option is available. This will activate the *File Scan* window. The result of the scan will be shown as below.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/spybot_64.png)

*Figure 9: File Scan - clean file*

**Note** Items with rootkit properties detected are not necessarily malware. Deleting such could cause an issue to another program. Refer to section **2.5 How to Scan for Threats** and **2.6 How to Restore a File** when dealing with files found during the *Rootkit Scan*.

**Step 7**. When you sure that the item found is suspicious you may **Delete** it from your system.

If you are not sure about the found items, you may ask for ‘help’ in Spybot [RootAlyzer Forum](http://forums.spybot.info/forumdisplay.php?f=46) before you delete anything. The deletion is final and can not be recovered through the Quarantine. If you still want to remove the found items it is strongly recommended to [create a system restore point](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-restore-faq) before doing that.
