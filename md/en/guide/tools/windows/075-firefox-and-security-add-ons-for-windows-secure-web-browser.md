{{ tool: ./075-tool.md }}

# What you will get from this guide

- A stable and secure Internet browser whose features can be enhanced by numerous add-ons.
- The ability to protect yourself from potentially dangerous programs and malicious web sites.
- The ability to wipe any traces of your browsing sessions from the computer.

# 1. Introduction to Firefox

This guide assumes that you already know how to use a web browser; it will not explain how to use the Firefox browser functions. Its purpose is to explain some additional functions that will make its use more secure.


## 1.0 Other tools like Firefox

**GNU Linux, Mac OS and other Microsoft Windows Compatible Programs:**

The **Mozilla Firefox** browser is available for **GNU Linux**, **Mac OS**, **Microsoft Windows** and other operating systems. The secure management of web pages is absolutely *vital*, as they are most common source of malware infection. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you use **Mozilla Firefox** and the prescribed add-ons for this purpose. The security advantages available in **Firefox**, a cross-platform free and open source program, are even more important when compared to its commercial equivalents like **Internet Explorer**. However, if you would prefer to use a program other than **Mozilla Firefox**, we recommend the following alternatives available for **GNU Linux**, **Mac OS** and **Microsoft Windows**:

- [**Google Chrome**](http://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [**Opera**](http://www.opera.com/)

## 1.1 Things you should know about Firefox before you start

Firefox has many easy-to-use add-ons/extensions and plug-ins for protecting your privacy and security whenever you access the internet. You can configure them depending on your particular situation:

* If you are using your personal computer, and do not allow others to use it for browsing purposes, you only need to configure these settings once.
* If you are in a public location or at work, you may have to repeatedly re-configure these settings for your own use.

To increase the privacy and security of your Firefox web browser, and of your internet experience as a whole, you will learn how to download, install and use the following through this guide: 

* [**HTTPS Everywhere**](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere)  
* [**Privacy Badger**](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger)
* [**NoScript**](https://noscript.net/) 
* [**Click&Clean**](http://www.hotcleaner.com/)  

You can find our recommendations for additional privacy-enhancing browser add-ons through Tactical Tech's [**MyShadow resources section**](https://myshadow.org/resources).

**Important:** The overwhelming majority of malware and spyware infections originate from webpages. It is very important that you always consider whether it is safe to open a given website, especially if you received it via email. Before you decide to open a webpage, we recommend that you scan the web address using the following page scanners:

* [www.virustotal.com](http://www.virustotal.com/) 
* [www.onlinelinkscan.com](http://onlinelinkscan.com/) 
* [www.phishtank.com](http://www.phishtank.com/index.php) 

You can also check the reputation of a website using the scanners listed below:

* [http://safeweb.norton.com](http://safeweb.norton.com/) 
* [www.urlvoid.com](http://www.urlvoid.com/) 

# 2. Install and Configure Firefox

**Firefox** has many easy-to-use settings for protecting your privacy and security whenever you access the Internet. How frequently you may have to configure these settings depends on your particular situation: 

- If you are using your personal computer, and do not allow others to use it for browsing purposes, you need only configure these settings once. 

- If you are in a public location or at work, you may have to repeatedly re-configure these settings for your own use. 

**Note**: You may also use a portable version of **Firefox** on a USB memory stick with you. This lets you configure **Firefox** according to your requirements, and you can use this version on any public computer. For more information about **Firefox** portable, please refer to [**Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition**](#815).

## 2.3 Configure Privacy Options

The *Privacy* pane lets you manage privacy and security options for the browser. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-07.png) to activate the following screen: 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-08.png)

*Figure 3: The Options window displaying the Privacy pane*

The *Privacy* pane is divided into three sections: The *Tracking* section, the *History* section and the *Location bar* section. 

- **The Tracking section**

The *Do Not Track* section lets you determine whether you wish your internet activities and behaviours to be monitored or tracked by third parties, for instance, advertising companies, analytic services, or market researchers. The first time **Firefox** is installed, the default setting is *Do not tell sites anything about my preferences* and must be changed; enabling the *Tell sites I do not want to be tracked option* notifies participating companies and organizations that you do not wish to be tracked.

**Note**: The *Do Not Track* option is based on an honour system and is voluntary; as such, individual web sites are neither legally nor technically compelled to respect such requests. Although a growing number of respectful and responsible organizations are participants, the *Do Not Track* option must be complemented by other add-ons or plugins that effectively target the commercial or malicious interests; enabling this option reduces your exposure to potentially harmful advertisements online. For more information about **Firefox** add-ons, please refer to [**More Useful Firefox Add-Ons**](#803).  

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-09.png)

*Figure 4: The Tracking section*

**Step 1**. **Check** the *Tell sites I do not want to be tracked* option (as shown in *Figure 4* above) to have your privacy and security respected by the participants.

- **The History section**

The *History* section lets you manage your **Firefox** browser 'history', that is, a list of all the different sites you have visited since you began using **Firefox**. The default *Firefox will:* option is *Remember history* and must be changed to protect your internet privacy and security. 

To eliminate traces of your browsing history, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Activate** the *Firefox will:* drop-down list and **select** the *Never remember history* item as shown in *Figure 3*. 

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-10.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-11.png)

*Figure 5: The Clear All History window*

**Step 3**. **Select** all check-boxes and **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-12.png) to clear **Firefox** of all potentially revealing data, and return to the *Privacy* pane. 

- **The Location Bar section**

The *Location Bar* section uses addresses, cookies and other temporary data from bookmarked web sites, and the web history to prompt or suggest addresses in the **Firefox** **Universal Resource Locator** (**URL**) bar for your browsing convenience. The default *When using the location bar, suggest:* option is *History and Bookmarks*, and must be changed to protect your internet privacy and security. 

To eliminate traces of your browsing habits and history, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Activate** the *When using the location bar, suggest* drop-down list and then **select** the **Nothing** item as shown in *Figure 6* below and *Figure 3* above:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-13.png)

*Figure 6: The Location Bar displaying the Nothing item*

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-14.png) to confirm your settings and exit the *Options* window. 

**Note**: For a more secure and thorough approach to deleting temporary data, please refer to the chapter on [**CCleaner**](../ccleaner/windows).



## 2.4 Configure Security Options

The *Security* pane is divided into two sections: the first deals with potentially threatening actions from external sources and the second, or *Passwords* section, with password management. 

**Note**: For more information on password storage, please refer to the chapter on [**KeePass**](../keepass/windows).

**Step 1**. **Select Tools > Options** in the **Firefox** menu bar to activate the *Options* window, and then **click** the *Security* tab to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-15.png)

*Figure 7: The Options window displaying the Security pane*

**Step 2**. **Accept** the default settings in the first section. 

- **The Passwords section**

The *Passwords* section lets you manage your passwords. The default *Remember passwords for sites* option is enabled the first time you install and run **Firefox**, and must be disabled to ensure your password privacy and security. We recommend to securely store passwords in [**KeePass**](../keepass/windows).

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-14.png) to complete the configuration of the *Security* pane in the *Options* window.



## 2.5 Configure Advanced Options

The *Advanced* tab, as its name suggests, is designed with the **Advanced** or **Experienced** **Firefox** user in mind. However, users of *all* levels will benefit from enabling the following option in the *General* tab. 

- The *Warn me when websites try to redirect or reload the page* option enables **Firefox** to prevent web sites from automatically redirecting you to another page, or reloading themselves without your consent or knowledge. 

 ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-16.png)

*Figure 8: The Advanced pane options with the default General tab displayed*

**Step 1**. **Enable** checkbox *Warn me when websites try to redirect or reload the page* option as shown in *Figure 8* above.

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-14.png) to apply these changes and exit the *Advanced* tab.

Congratulations! **Firefox** is now configured to browse the Internet in a private and secure manner.


# 3. Firefox Add-Ons

In the context of **Mozilla** products, an add-on is simply a lightweight software program which adds new features or extends existing functionality. As such, add-ons are sometimes referred to as *extensions*. For instance, the **NoScript** add-on extends **Firefox** functionality to block scripts from defined servers. 

A **plugin** is essentially a piece of software usually designed by a third party to enable the use of their software within **Firefox** browser. An example of a common plugin would be the **Flash** plugin designed to display **Adobe Flash** content within the **Firefox** browser window.

## 3.2 Disable or Remove Firefox Add-Ons

The *Add-ons* tab displays all installed add-ons as shown in *Figure 8*. Any **Mozilla** add-on can be either temporarily disabled by **clicking** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-34.png) or completely removed by **clicking** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-35.png). However, in some instances **Firefox** *must* be restarted for the changes to take effect. 

<a name="3.3"></a>

## 3.3 Update Mozilla Add-ons

Every so often, the various add-ons designed for use must be updated to be compatible or current with the latest version of **Firefox**. Depending on your connection speed, you may choose to either update these add-ons automatically or manually. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-36.png) to activate its associated menu, and then **select** *Check for updates* item to manually update your add-ons as shown in *Figure 9* below.

*Figure 9: The Add-ons Manager update button displaying its associated drop-down list*

**Step 2**. Alternatively, **select** the *Update Add-ons Automatically* item to update your add-ons automatically as shown in *Figure 9 above*. 

<a name="3.4"></a>

## 3.4 Update Mozilla Plugins

Given that a few plugins may not automatically update themselves, users are strongly recommended to check for the latest updates of **Mozilla Plugins**. 

To manually check for updates of plugins, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** [**https://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck**](https://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck) to activate the following site:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-38.png)

*Figure 10: The Mozilla Firefox Plugin Check & Updates site*

**Step 2**. **Address** each plugin issue presented on the web page, indicated by the status on the button as follows:

- For plugins displaying ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-39.png) we **strongly** recommend that you *immediately* update them by clicking this button, and follow its instruction page. (Alternatively, please follow the steps after this list of buttons to disable or remove obsolete plugins.) 

- For plugins displaying ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-45.png), consider disabling or removing them unless the plugins are required and updated individually.

- For plugins displaying ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-47.png), review them individually to determine which are required, and disable or remove those which are unknown or unnecessary.

To **disable** an unknown plugin or one that is no longer required, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Select Tools > Add-ons** to activate the *Add-ons Manager* tab. 

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-40.png) to reveal a complete list of **Mozilla Firefox** plugins, identify the plugin you would like to disable, and then **click**  ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-34.png).

To **remove a plugin** from your computer:

**Step 1**.  **Click Start > Control Panel**.

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-41.png).

**Step 3**. **Select** the relevant program from the window, and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-43.png). 

Repeat these steps until all the issues on the *Plugin Check & Updates* page are resolved. It is *absolutely essential* that you search for updates on a **monthly basis** at minimum. Plugins are constantly being improved and upgraded to deal with all manner of evolving security problems. 

**IMPORTANT**: The **Adobe Flash** and **Oracle Java** browser plugins are often found to contain security vulnerabilities that could allow a remote user to assume control of your computer or install malware. It is **strongly** advised that you disable both of those plugins in **Firefox**. For more information about how to disable or remove Java, please refer to Oracle's [steps to disable Java for all browsers on your computer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) or their [guide on how to uninstall Java from your computer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_java.xml).


# 4. The NoScript Add-On

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/noscript_logo.png)

**NoScript** is a particularly useful **Mozilla Add-on** that can help protect your computer from malicious websites on the Internet. It operates by implementing a 'white list' of sites that you have determined as acceptable, safe or trusted (like a home-banking site or an on-line journal). All other sites are considered potentially harmful and their functioning is restricted, until you have determined that the content of a particular site presents no harm; at this point, you may add it to the white list. 

**NoScript** will automatically start blocking all banners, pop-up advertisements, **JavaScript** and **Java** code, as well as other potentially harmful web site attributes. **NoScript** cannot differentiate between harmful content and content necessary to correctly display a web site. It is up to you to make exceptions for those sites with content that you think is safe. 

<a name="4.1"></a>

## 4.1 Use the NoScript Add-On

Before you begin using **NoScript** ensure that it was successfully installed by **selecting Tools > Add-ons** to activate the *Add-ons* window and confirm that it has been installed.

**Tip**: Although **NoScript** might seem a little frustrating at first (as the websites you have always visited may not display properly), you will immediately profit from the automated object-blocking feature. This will restrict pesky advertisements, pop-up messages and malicious code built (or hacked) into web pages.  

**NoScript** will run silently in the background until it detects the presence of **JavaScript**, **Adobe Flash** or other script-like content. At that point **NoScript** will block this content and status bar will appear on the bottom of the **Firefox** window as follows: 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-50.png)

*Figure 1: The NoScript status bar*

The **NoScript** status bar displays information about which *objects* (for example, advertisements and pop-up messages) and *scripts* are currently prevented from executing themselves on your system. The following two figures are prime examples of **NoScript** at work: In *Figure 2*, **NoScript** has successfully blocked an advertisement created in **Adobe Flash Player** on a commercial website. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-51.png)

*Figure 2: An example of NoScript blocking a pop-up advertisement in a commercial site*

In *Figure 3*, the **Twitter** web site notifies you that **JavaScript** must be enabled (at least temporarily) to view this web site. 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-52.png)

*Figure 3: The Twitter web site requesting that JavaScript be enabled*

Since **NoScript** does not differentiate between malicious and real code, certain key features and functions (for instance, a tool bar) may be missing. Some web pages present content, including script-like content, from more than one website. For example, a website like **www.twitter.com** has two sources of scripts (*twitter.com* and *twimg.com*): 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-53.png)

*Figure 4: An example of the NoScript status bar Options menu*

To unblock scripts in these circumstances, start by **selecting** the *Temporarily Allow [website name]* option (in this instance, *Temporarily allow twitter.com*). However, if this does not allow you to view the page you may determine, through a process of trial and error, the minimum number of websites required to view your chosen content. For instance, on **Twitter**, you must **select** the *Temporarily allow twitter.com* and *Temporarily allow twimg.com* options, in order for **Twitter** to work.

**Warning**! Under **no** circumstances should you ever select the *Allow Scripts Globally (dangerous)* option. As far as possible, avoid selecting the *Allow all from this page* option. Occasionally, you may have to permit all scripts; in this situation, ensure that you only do this temporarily for sites you really trust, that is, until the end of your on-line session. It only takes a *single* injection of malicious code to compromise your on-line privacy and safety. 

For websites that you trust and frequently visit, **select** the *Allow [website name]* option. (In the example above, *Allow twitter.com* and *Allow twimg.com* have been selected). Selecting this option permits **NoScript** to permanently list that website as trusted.


# 5. Useful Firefox Add-Ons

The **Mozilla Firefox Add-ons** featured in this section are designed to enhance or protect the anonymity, privacy and security of your browsing sessions. To download them, please refer to the [**Downloading Firefox**](#791) section.

## 5.1 HTTPS Everywhere

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-101.png)

**HTTPS Everywhere** is a **Mozilla Firefox** extension ensuring that you always communicate with specified list of websites over an encrypted (*https*) channel. Although many websites do offer encryption, they tend default to an unencrypted http address. The **HTTPS Everywhere** extension fixes these problems by rewriting all your requests to these sites to the **HTTPS** protocol. It runs silently in the background, ensuring that your Internet sessions with those selected sites are safe and secure. However, it works *only* when those sites are using the **HTTPS** protocol themselves.

After the **HTTPS Everywhere** extension has been successfully installed, the following screen will appear:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-75.png)

*Figure 1: The Should HTTPS Everywhere Use the SSL Observatory? prompt screen* 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-76.png) to activate the following screen: 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-77.png)

*Figure 2: The SSL Observatory Preferences screen* 

**Note**: If there has been a previous installation of **HTTPS Everywhere** on your **Firefox** browser, **select Tools > HTTPS Everywhere > SSL Observatory Preferences** and verify that the *Use the Observatory* and *When you see a new certificate, tell the Observatory which ISP you are connected to* options are enabled. If you are not using **Tor**, **enable** the *Check certificates even if Tor is not available* option as well.

## 5.2 Adblock Plus

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-102.png)

**Adblock Plus** is a content filtering extension designed to limit or restrict the ability of ads to display themselves. 

After **Adblock Plus** has been successfully installed, the following page will be launched: 
[**chrome://adblockplus/content/ui/firstRun.html**](chrome://adblockplus/content/ui/firstRun.html)
 
![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-60.png)

*Figure 3: The Adblock Plus chrome content page*

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-61.png) so that it changes to ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-62.png) for the *Malware Blocking*, *Remove Social Media Buttons* and *Disable Tracking* options (as shown in *Figure 1* above).

**Step 2**. **Select Tools > Adblock Plus > Filter preferences...** to activate the following window:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-63.png)

*Figure 4: The Add Adblock Plus Filter Preferences displaying three filter subscriptions*

**Step 2**. **Click** each filter subscription checkbox to enable it (as shown in *Figure 2* above), and then **disable** the ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/firefox-win-64.png) option, to prevent *all* advertisements described or listed in these filters from displaying themselves.

**Step 3**.

# 6. Portable Firefox





## 6.1 Differences between the Installed and Portable versions of Firefox

Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected.

# FAQ

***Q***: Why would I want so many different add-ons to defend myself against malicious websites? If **NoScript** protects me from potentially dangerous scripts, for example, why do I also need other add-ons which function in a similar way?

***A***: It is often a good idea to use more than one tool to address the same general security issue. (Anti-virus programs are an important exception to this rule, since they tend to conflict with one another.) These **Firefox** add-ons use very different techniques to protect your browser from a variety of threats. **NoScript**, for example, blocks all scripts from unknown websites, but users tend to 'whitelist' the websites they visit frequently, which allows them to load potentially-malicious scripts. **NoScript** users also tend to allow unknown sites to load scripts, on a temporary basis, if those scripts are necessary for the page to function properly.
