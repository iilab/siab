***Asani:*** So, now you want me to install anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software? Can my computer cope with all that?

They're made to work together, so installing them all shouldn't cause any problems. Remember, though, you don't want want to run two anti-virus programs or two firewalls at the same time.
