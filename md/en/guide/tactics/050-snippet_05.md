***Borna:*** You're telling me my phone might be talking to the towers about my whereabouts, even it looks as though it's switched off?

***Delir:*** Yeah, and that is not the worst case

***Borna:*** Oh?

***Delir:*** Well, they are saying that there are programs that can be installed on your phone to secretly, remotely turn it on, and have it call a number without your knowledge. Then, as you start your meeting, it would start acting like a recording and transmitting device.

***Borna:*** No! really?.

***Delir:*** Well, it is pretty easily done technologically. But none of that can happen if the battery is disconnected, so you will be safe in this unlikely case.

***Borna:*** I guess I will just not take it with me if I want to be super careful. But I wonder if I should use this thing at all then?

***Delir:*** Please, father. You used to tell me not to be afraid of new things. Mobiles are like that, you just have to know what the benefits and risks are. Just be careful. If you know the risks, you can take steps to avoid them.
