***Pablo:*** One of the guys who's going to be working on this report with us tends to use his Yahoo webmail account when he's not in the office.And I seem to remember somebody else using Hotmail. If I send a message to these guys, can other people read it?

***Claudia:*** Probably. Yahoo, Hotmail and plenty of other webmail providers have insecure websites that don't protect the privacy of their users' messages. We're going to have to change some people's habits if we want to be able to discuss these testimonies securely.
