***Elena:*** I still have an old CD backup of the webserver logs, and I heard that you can erase a CD by putting it in the microwave. Somehow, though, it sounds like a really bad idea to me. Do people really do that? Does it work?

***Nikolai:*** I imagine it destroys the data pretty effectively, but I wouldn't know, because I'd never put a CD in my microwave! You're right. That sounds like a terrible idea. Even if the metal doesn't damage your microwave or start a fire, I bet that plastic would give off some pretty unhealthy fumes. Come to think of it, I wouldn't recommend burning CDs in a fire, either.
