***Rudo:*** I'm a bit nervous about messing around in BIOS. Can I break my computer if I do something wrong?

***Otto:*** You sure can, at least for a little while. In fact, the settings that you might want to change are pretty simple, but the BIOS screen itself can be a little intimidating, and it is possible to leave your computer temporarily unable to start if you do something wrong. In general, if you're uncomfortable working in BIOS, you should ask someone with more computer experience to help you out.
