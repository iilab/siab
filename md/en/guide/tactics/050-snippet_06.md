***Borna:*** What if I never make calls on my mobile, and only send and receive these small messages. They can't listen in on something if no one is saying anything, and it is very quick, no?

***Delir:*** Wait a minute. These messages are also easy enough to intercept, and anyone with access to the traffic from the phone company, or even other people with the right equipment, can capture and read these messages which are moving around the network in plain text, being saved from one tower to the next. 

***Borna:*** That's just silly. What should I do? Write in code like we did during the war?

***Delir:*** Well, sometimes the oldest shoes are the most comfortable ones.
