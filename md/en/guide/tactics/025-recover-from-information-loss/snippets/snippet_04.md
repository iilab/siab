***Elena:*** Alright, so I made an encrypted backup while I was at work, and I put it on a CD. Cobian is scheduled to update my backup in a few days. My desk at work has a drawer that locks, and I'm planning to keep these backup CDs in there so they won't get lost or broken.

***Nikolai:*** But what if your office burns down? Computer, desk, backup CDs and all? Or, what if your website forum gets used to plan some giant environmental demonstration, the authorities crack down, things get out of hand, and the organisation is raided? I doubt your little desk lock will keep the police from confiscating those CDs. What about keeping them at home, or asking a friend to store them for you?
