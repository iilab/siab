***Claudia:*** Alright, so let's toss some junk into the standard volume, and then we can move all our testimonies into the hidden one. Do you have some old PDFs or something we can use?

***Pablo:*** Well, I was thinking about that. I mean, the idea is for us to give up the decoy password if we have no other choice, right? But, for that to be convincing, we need to make sure those files look kind of important, don't you think? Otherwise, why would we bother to encrypt them? Maybe we should use some unrelated financial documents or a list of website passwords or something.
