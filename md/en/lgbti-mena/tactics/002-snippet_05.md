In March 2013, [**two Emirati men were arrested**](http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/two-men-jailed-for-prostitution-in-uae-1.1165170) on charges of “breaching public morality” and “inciting others to commit a sin.” The two men had profiles on the social network “WhosHere”, where they allegedly posted pictures of themselves in women’s clothes and full make-up. The fact that the two men published their pictures on a public website led to the discovery of their profiles by the police, who communicated with them pretending to be a “customer” and set up a trap in order to arrest them. They were sentenced each to three years in prison. A week before this incident, a [**Filipino man was also arrested in the same manner**](http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/crime/man-jailed-a-year-over-male-prostitution-1.1158012), after the police tracked him down on the Internet, where he had a profile with his pictures and phone number, advertising himself as a sex worker offering services to male clients.
