**Accounts of attacks and censorship**

[**Two men were arrested**](http://www.elkhabar.com/ar/nas/334385.html) in May, 2013, on accusations of “breaching public morality” and “incitement to debauchery” because they allegedly announced their marriage on Facebook and addressed one another there as “husband” and “wife.” Some people who accessed the men’s Facebook profiles reported them to the police, which led to arresting both men. Ultimately, they confessed that they did this and were sent to jail temporarily.
