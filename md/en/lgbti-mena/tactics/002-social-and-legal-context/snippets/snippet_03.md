**Accounts of attacks and censorship**

In 2009, a horrific wave of targeting gay men in Iraq started to gain momentum. A group of extremists started to [**entrap gay men using chat rooms**](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/13/iraq-gays-murdered-militias); they would set up fake profiles and seduce target persons into meeting them, and after they met, the extremists would kidnap and torture the persons until they “repented” or, in some cases, died. Large numbers of homosexuals were targeted through the Internet, and this is unlikely to have changed. Recently, in a very extreme wave of hatred and discrimination against “emos” and LGBT persons, [**extremists have murdered many**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17450437) on the suspicion that they were homosexual, and pictures of the victims were published online as a means to threaten others and warn them of the consequences of “looking different” or behaving “against Islamic morals.”
