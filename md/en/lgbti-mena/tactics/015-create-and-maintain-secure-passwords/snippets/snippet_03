***Mansour:*** Wait a minute. If KeePass uses a single master password to protect all of your other passwords, how is it more secure than just using that same password for all of your accounts? I mean, if a bad guy learns the master password, he gets access to everything, right?

***Magda:*** It's a good thought, and you're right that protecting your master password is really important, but there are a couple of key differences. First of all, this 'bad guy' would not only need your password, he'd need your KeePass database file, too. If you just share the same password between all of your accounts, then he'd only need the password itself. Plus, we know that KeePass is extremely secure, right? Well, other programs and websites can go either way. Some of them are much less secure than others, and you don't want someone breaking into a weak website, and then using what he learns to access a more secure account. And there's another thing, too. KeePass makes it really easy to change your master password if you think it's necessary. I should be so lucky! I spent all day today updating my passwords.
