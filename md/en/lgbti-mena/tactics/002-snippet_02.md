**Accounts of attacks and censorship**

In the years following the Queen Boat incident in 2001, where 52 men were arrested on accusations of engaging in debauchery, the habit of [**entrapping gay men online**](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/4422172/#.UZScxMpu8UR) became an all too common practice for the Egyptian police. They would set up profiles on gay social networks and seduce willing individuals into meeting them, and then arrest them. Allegedly, the arrested individuals would suffer torture and imprisonment. Although this practice was at its peak during the years that followed the Queen Boat incident, during the Egyptian revolution, the government and police still continued the practice of censoring and tracking individuals because of their online activities.
