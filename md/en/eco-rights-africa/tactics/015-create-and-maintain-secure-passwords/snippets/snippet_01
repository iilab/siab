**Mansour** and **Magda** are siblings, in an Arabic-speaking country, who maintain a blog on which they anonymously publicise human rights abuses and campaign for political change. Magda recently tried to log into her personal webmail account and found that her password had been changed. After resetting the password, she was able to log in, but when she opened her inbox she noticed that several new messages were marked as having been read. She suspects that a politically-motivated intruder may have learned or guessed her password, which she uses for several of her website accounts. She is meeting with Mansour, who has less computer experience, to explain the situation and to voice her concerns.
