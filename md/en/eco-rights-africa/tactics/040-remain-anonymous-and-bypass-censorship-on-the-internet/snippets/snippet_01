**Mansour** and **Magda** are siblings, in an Arabic-speaking country, who maintain a blog on which they anonymously publicise human rights abuses and campaign for political change. The authorities in their country have not been able to shut down their website, because it is hosted in another country, but they have often tried to learn the identity of the blog's administrators from other activists. Mansour and Magda are concerned that the authorities may be able to monitor their updates and learn who they are. In addition, they want to prepare for when the government eventually filters their website, not only so that they can continue updating it, but also in order to provide good circumvention advice to readers within their own country, who would otherwise lose access to the blog.
