*Elena*: I know some people who keep all of their important documents on Gmail, by attaching them to 'draft' messages or emails to themselves. Would that count as a 'second physical location' for my files?

*Nikolai*: It might help you recover if you lose one or two very important documents, but it's pretty awkward. Honestly, how many documents per week would you be willing to back up like that? Plus, you need to consider whether or not those attachments are safe, especially if you're at all worried about your email being monitored. Unless you're connecting to Gmail securely, this is a bit like handing over your sensitive information on a silver platter. Using an HTTPS connection to Gmail in order to back up small Truecrypt volumes or KeePass database files would be pretty safe, because they're encrypted, but I really wouldn't recommend this as a general-purpose backup strategy.
