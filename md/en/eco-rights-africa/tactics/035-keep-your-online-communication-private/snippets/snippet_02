*Pablo*: I was talking to one of our partners about all this, and she said that she and her colleagues sometimes just save important messages in the 'Drafts' folder of a webmail account where they all share a password. It sounds kind of strange to me, but would it work? I mean, wouldn't that prevent anyone from reading the messages, since they're never actually sent?

*Claudia*: Any time you read an email on your computer, even if it's just a 'draft,' its contents have been sent to you over the Internet. Otherwise, it couldn't appear on your screen, right? The thing is, if someone has you under surveillance, they don't just monitor your email messages, they can scan all readable information going to and from your computer. In other words, this trick wouldn't work unless everyone connects securely to that shared webmail account. And, if they do, then it really doesn't hurt to create separate accounts or to go ahead and hit that 'send' button.
