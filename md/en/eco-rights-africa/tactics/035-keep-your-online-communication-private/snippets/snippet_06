*Pablo*: But how does all this work?

*Claudia*: Clever mathematics! You encode messages to a given email contact using her special 'public key', which she can distribute freely. Then, she uses her secret 'private key', which she has to guard carefully, in order to read those messages. In turn, your contact uses your public key to encrypt messages that she writes to you. So, in the end, you do have to exchange public keys, but you can share them openly, without having to worry about the fact that anybody who wants your public key can get it.
