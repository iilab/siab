***Accounts of attacks and censorship***

If you go on some social network and you let people know you're a lesbian, or even if you don't and some guy would just pretend that he's a girl and you think you're talking to a girl, you start exchanging pictures and he keeps all the pictures. He would even send a nude picture of a girl! I met someone on Badoo once, we were talking, so I said 'give me your number' but I couldn't call immediately. So later I called and it was a guy's voice!
