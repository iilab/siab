In Nigeria, police and ordinary citizens set up profiles on dating sites to attract gay men. In 2012, a newspaper article appeared to glorify one of such groups that had set up a punishment group that trapped and specialized in extorting gay men. "We call them up, set a meeting in a hotel room then snap pictures in compromising positions. We then use this to collect money from them" said one of the young men. 

The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya [say](http://irasciblemusings.com/nairobi-police-say-closeted-gays-being-blackmailed-and-attacked-by-gangs-2/) incidents of blackmail and extortion are high and constantly growing within the country and accounts for one of the highest crimes committed against LGBTI persons.
