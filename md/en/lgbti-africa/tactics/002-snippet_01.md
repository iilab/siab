***Example incidents*** 

In August 2012, the offices of Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ) were raided by police and computers and other material was seized on suspicion of containing pornography or material insulting of the President. The materials were held for two years until GALZ [won a court case](http://www.galz.co.zw/?p=1109) ordering their return in January 2014. 

In Uganda in 2013, a 65-year-old businessman was arrested and charged with “trafficking obscene publications” after his computer was stolen and gay pornography stored on it was discovered. The thieves passed the material to Uganda’s *Red Pepper* newspaper which splashed details of the video on its front page under the headline: “Exposed – Top City Tycoons Sodomy Sex Video Leaks”, and the material was subsequently passed to the police and used as a basis for his prosecution.

In January 2014, the offices of the LGBTI rights organisation "Alternative" in Côte d'Ivoire were [attacked](http://frontlinedefenders.org/node/24775) by an angry mob of local residents, and all their computers were stolen.

*"We go to meetings where our houses can be raided, information found and used against us as activists to indicate we are promoting LGBTI propaganda. We travel with our laptops to meetings, workshops and seminars, and airports especially can be a risky place if you are detained or even loose your luggage!"*– Anonymous Human Rights Defender
