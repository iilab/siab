***Borna:*** Is there anything else about this phone that I need to know?

***Delir:*** I guess yes, but it depends if you really suspect they are trying to track you down.

***Borna:*** I don't think so, but can they do that? 

***Delir:*** Well, yes, if you have your phone turned on, AND the technician has access to the network traffic, AND they know which phone on the system is your phone.

***Borna:*** That won't happen because I simply won't make a call on my phone when I go there.

***Delir:*** That doesn't matter father. As long as you have your phone with you, charged and ready to use, it will keep track of where you go, and talk to the towers of the network nearby, simply because it has to. So at any given time, your location is somewhere between the closest towers of the phone network.

***Borna:*** So I should turn it off until I get there?

***Delir:*** Well, of course the best thing to do is not to take it with you. The next best thing is for you to have it switched off AND take the battery out of it before you go, and not turn it on until you get back.

***Borna:*** What? isn't it enough to turn it off?

***Delir:*** Well, to be on the safe side, you should take the battery out, and here's why: this is a transmission device, and as long as the battery is connected, there is a small chance that somehow someone may turn it on without your knowledge.
