***Borna:*** Son, I have decided only to use this mobile for planning our meetings from now on, because I think they might be listening to the factory floor phone, and maybe even at the house.

***Delir:*** Father, it's great you have finally got a mobile phone, but do you know what it can and cannot do?

***Borna:*** Of course: it is a phone! You call someone, you talk to them, they talk back. You can do this from wherever you are. AND, I can send small messages on it to the others, or to you, and they will show up in your phone.

***Delir:*** This is all true, but it's not all. There are plenty of things you can do these days with these devices. But let's talk about some risks and safety precautions, especially if you think someone might be interested in finding out who you are communicating with, and what you are saying.
