**Borna** and his son **Delir** are both line workers in a factory, and are helping to create a workers' union. Their efforts are meeting the resistance of the factory owners, who are also well-connected in their local government. Borna's supervisor has warned him that he may be under scrutiny by management, and to beware of who he talks to. Borna has purchased a mobile phone for his union work. Delir is helping his father to use his new mobile phone safely for some of his organising activities.
