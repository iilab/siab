***Example incidents***

In Nigeria, police and ordinary citizens set up profiles on dating sites to attract gay men. In 2012, a newspaper article appeared to glorify one of such groups that had set up a punishment group that trapped and specialized in extorting gay men. "We call them up, set a meeting in a hotel room then snap pictures in compromising positions. We then use this to collect money from them" said one of the young men. 

The Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya [say](http://irasciblemusings.com/nairobi-police-say-closeted-gays-being-blackmailed-and-attacked-by-gangs-2/) incidents of blackmail and extortion are high and constantly growing within the country and accounts for one of the highest crimes committed against LGBTI persons.

***Human Rights Defender Testimonies***

*"If you go on some social network and you let people know you're a lesbian, or even if you don't and some guy would just pretend that he's a girl and you think you're talking to a girl, you start exchanging pictures and he keeps all the pictures. He would even send a nude picture of a girl! I met someone on Badoo once, we were talking, so I said 'give me your number', but I couldn't call immediately. So later I called and it was a guy's voice!"* -- Anonymous Human Rights Defender
    
*"We had an intern recently who met somebody on Facebook, and they invited him and the person pretended that he was a partner. He went for an appointment and met five other people in an isolated part of town! He got beaten silly, he got stripped naked and photographed naked, they threatened that they would put that on Facebook, and they took all the money he had on him and his phones as well. And it wasn't possible to report to the police because then the story would all come out and they would be worse off for it."* -- Anonymous Human Rights Defender
