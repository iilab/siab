***Human Rights Defender Testimonies***:
   
*"We use [Tor Browser](torbrowser/windows) a lot to remain anonymous when we are getting in touch with other MSM men. That is because you never know who is watching what sites you are going to. All my searches on google used to show on my history but with Tor, that is not the case."* — Anonymous Human Rights Defender

*"I use Tor every day. I also use [Orbot](orbot/android) on my phone so I always enjoying being anonymous when using the phone or computer."* — Anonymous Human Rights Defender
