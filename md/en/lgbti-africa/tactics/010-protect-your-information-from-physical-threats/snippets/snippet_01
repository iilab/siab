**Shingai** and **Rudo** are an elderly married couple with many years of experience helping the HIV-infected population of Zimbabwe maintain access to proper medication. They are applying for a grant to purchase new computers and network equipment for their office. Since they live in a region that is quite turbulent, in terms both of politics and of infrastructure, they and their potential funders want to ensure that their new hardware will be safe, not only from hackers and viruses, but also from confiscation, thunderstorms, electrical spikes and other such disasters. They ask **Otto**, a local computer technician, to help them devise a plan of action to strengthen the physical security of the computers and network hardware they plan to buy if their grant application is successful.
