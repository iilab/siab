**Claudia** and **Pablo** work with a human rights NGO in a South American country. After spending several months collecting testimonies from witnesses to the human rights violations that have been committed by the military in their region, Claudia and Pablo have begun taking steps to protect the resulting data. They have kept only the information they need, which they store in a TrueCrypt partition that is backed up in several physical locations. While preparing to publish certain aspects of these testimonies in a report, they have found that they must discuss sensitive information with a few of their colleagues in another country. Although they have agreed not to mention names or locations, they still want to ensure that their email and instant messaging conversations on this topic remain private. After calling a meeting to discuss the importance of communication security, Claudia has asked if anyone in the office has questions.
