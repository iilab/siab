***Human Rights Defender Testimonies***:

*"Digital Security is extremely important for human rights lawyers and LGBTI activists in this part of the world. In Nigeria for example, the government has employed the services of cyber security gurus from Israel and other developed countries to hack into and gather intelligence from hapless and ignorant citizens, especially human rights activists, to be able to gain knowledge of their work, their communication and track down their activities."* -- Anonymous Human Rights Defender

*"The state has interest in accessing information relating to our work, and mainly our databases. This includes through confiscation of computers, but also phone tapping, surveillance, and interfering with our Internet Service Provider"* â€” Anonymous Human Rights Defender
