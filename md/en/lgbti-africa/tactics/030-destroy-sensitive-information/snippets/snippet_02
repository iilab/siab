***Elena:*** I know word processing programs like Microsoft Word and Open Office sometimes make temporary copies of a file while you're working on it. Do other programs do that too, or should I mostly just worry about files that I create and delete myself?

***Nikolai:*** Actually, there are lots of places on your computer where programs leave traces of your personal information and online activities. I'm talking about websites you've visited, draft emails you've worked on recently and other things like that. All of this stuff could be sensitive, depending on how often you use that
computer.
