**Elena** is an environmentalist in a Russian-speaking country, where she maintains an increasingly-popular website that highlights the extent of illegal deforestation in the region. She has created a backup of the information used to create the website, and she keeps copies of it at home, in the office and on her new laptop. Recently, she has also begun to store a copy of the webserver's visitor logs and the database containing her users' forum posts. Elena will soon be travelling internationally, to attend a large global conference of environmental activists, some of whom have reported having their laptops taken away for over an hour at border-crossings. To protect her sensitive information, and the safety of her more political forum participants, she has moved her home and office backups onto a TrueCrypt volume and removed the copy from her laptop. She asked her nephew **Nikolai** for advice, and he has warned her that she needs to do more than just delete her old backup if she is worried about having her computer seized by border officials.
