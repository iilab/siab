I get targeted as a woman especially as an older woman usually on Facebook with people who might have checked my profile and seen "Interested in: women". In the past I didn’t even know how to delete someone from my friends list or from my Skype but after a training I sat down and sifted through my friends list and removed the ones I felt I did not know and including those who have been harassing me.

Facebook is the most used to target people. Its very deceptive because you are seeing pictures but you think the pictures you are seeing is the person but it is not the person. What made me able to handle those kind of infiltrations was first to check for how long the person has been registered. Then if they are a new registration, I start to wonder why are they trying to friend me. Secondly, there are people you only have one common friend and that common friend is so remote so that is also I bad sign. Then when I go to photos and I see only one photo or 4 photos maximum, ahhh! Sometimes, I see that they are all profile pictures of different people and those people don’t even look the same. It gives me a hint that the photos have been stolen or photoshopped to give people a false impression that oh, I know you I have seen your face. I have learned to really check before giving people access to me. — Anonymous Human rights Defenders
