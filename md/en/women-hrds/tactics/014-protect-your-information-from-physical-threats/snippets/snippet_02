During one year we had several attacks on our office so we started realising the importance of the assessment. We nearly lost everything because of a criminal fire and because of all the water that was used to extinguish the fire. However, luckily for us, we quickly learned from every attack. The placement of the machines on the second floor, not on the third where the roof was burning, not in the waiting area nor visible to the eye, has saved our sensitive machines from the attacks that were normally happening on the first floor. 

We also want to believe that putting surveillance cameras, stronger and more secure locks and doors has tired and pressured the attackers so they sticked to breaking the first floor and leaving the second.

Of course we had luck, but strategising helped create the lucky circumstances. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
