As an Executive Director, I'm also very passionate about securing the data we have in our organisation, we provide counselling services for people with sexual disfunctions, so these are very sensitive issues and people dont' want their information to fly around the place. So when I tell people that their secrets are safe with me now I know what I'm talking about! Because indeed, we can make everything very safe, using TrueCrypt we can create these beautiful containers that people can't see on the surface when they enter our systems. The government has interest in the work we do, they have sent security agents several times to the organisation to interview us. Sometimes we get wind that they're coming so we have to take the paper, take things out of the office and hide them somewhere, you know - and that may not necessarily be safe either - so now we know that we can actually hide the stuff right there in that office, and they can check from roof to foundation and they won't find what's there. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
