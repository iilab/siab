I really, really love TrueCrypt and I wish more people in the community can use it. I give my computer to my sister a lot and now I am no longer bothered about her finding anything she shouldn’t. I put everything in a TueCrypt file and after that, I use CCleaner to wipe the computer before I give it to her. — Anonymous Human rights Defender
