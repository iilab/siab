I'm a legal practitioner working with the LGBTI community, especially women. TrueCrypt is important to my work because I deal with a lot of documents, I do a lot of analysis. That's important to me, I wouldn't like someone opening my laptop and seeing all that. It puts not only me but the people I work for at risk. And if I lose that data, it's almost like a warehouse for whatever they do. This empowers me to work safely, and to store it safely for them. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
