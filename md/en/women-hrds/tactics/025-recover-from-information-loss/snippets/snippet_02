Recently, I had an unfortunate accident where my laptop went for a swim in a lake. I also made the rookie mistake of having my backup in the same bag that fell into the lake so I lost both of them. The only positive is that I had a backup from 3 months before so that made life a little easier to bear. Now, Cobian and I are best friends. I do a weekly backup every weekend on two different devices so I am prepared for most eventualities. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
