When I connect the protection of the physical threats with the tools for recovering and backing up my information, the secure circle is becoming stronger so I can sleep better. At least the digital info can survive all the major risks that can happen to the office. It could be crushed but you have all the archive of your information and work, on your back up disc that you keep at home or on even safer place. What makes it even more interesting is how easy is to use Cobian Backup. Like all of us I have lost valuable data  and I had to recover it. So thanks to Recuva, I m not doing my back up every day anymore. I can be more relaxed. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
