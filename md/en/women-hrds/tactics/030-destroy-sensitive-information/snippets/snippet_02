The basic challenge is that we don't have the tools to do our work in a safe manner. Getting a basic computer for example. And when you do get one, as a woman in an African context, if you're living at home especially, you are going to share  your computer. We had a case maybe three months ago of a young activist who was doing some solicitation on Facebook and when she stepped away she just forgot to log out of her account, and came back – she was staying in a dorm at the university – and the roommates had had time to look at her computer. People are not out – she got evicted by the dorm, her roommates said they didn't want to share their room with a lesbian. — Anonymous Human rights Defender
