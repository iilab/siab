I had some sensitive information on my computer that I always felt pressure for having it. The research finished, we used the information, but then just deleting it didn't decrease my stress for someone finding that information. I wasn't very sure how storarge on my hard disc really works, and with since I knew in part that things can be recovered, I never felt safe even if those files were deleted. Discovering Ccleaner and Eraser made my life easier and my knowledge broader about the storage of the files and how things work. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
