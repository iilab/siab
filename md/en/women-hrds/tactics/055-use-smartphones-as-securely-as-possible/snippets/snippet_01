Smart phones have many applications at the disposal of the user. With internet accessibility, there is a tendency for the phone user to access Facebook, Twitter, Google etc. This makes the phone user much more vulnerable and insecure due to increased use because the user can be tracked by the service provider through IP as long as the mobile phone is on. Information being disseminated can be tapped into before it reaches the user. 

Most phone users are not aware of some of these security risks. Cyber criminals are aware of the security lapses that they circumvent to stalk their victims. Photo uploads from smart phones have been used to harass/intimidate women. We found out during our research that some women who upload their photos on Facebook, for example, have been victims of ridicule. A lady allowed a male “friend” to take her photo using mobile to then upload it on her Facebook account arguing it was blank and looking bad. No sooner did he do that than a sinister message/photo went viral that she was to be a witness at the Hague against the Kenyan accused at the International Criminal Court. She reacted by shutting her Facebook account. She underwent psychological harm and reported the matter to the police who promised to charge the offender under cyber crime. — Anonymous Human Rights Defender from Kenya
