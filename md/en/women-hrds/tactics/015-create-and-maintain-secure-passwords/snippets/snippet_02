We use the internet, we use Gmail, we decide that we don't talk by phone, just use the internet. But there's a lot of risk. Because when we are arrested – it's happened before – , we don't know from where, but they have our passwords, all of our information. We don't know how. Maybe some of the activists gave them their passwords, but I'm sure that some of them didn't. We don't know how they got them, but they use the information against us. — Anonymous Human rights Defender
