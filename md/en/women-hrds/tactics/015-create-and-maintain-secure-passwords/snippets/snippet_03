Keepass is lovely because I no longer have to remember any password. I have it on my computer, on my phone and on my iPad so it makes my life so easy when I am opening new accounts.

I use KeePassX for almost everything except Google, my PGP passphrase, and my actual devices. The reason I don't store my Google password is that I need a memorized one in case of emergency, so I can access my accounts. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
