It is amazing how one simple tool there like KeepassX can totally change your life without much effort. Of course it is about changing our habits first to make them more secure, but KeepassX was just what I needed to forget about the stress of my bad password used on every account. I did change my habits and I do feel more secure and less stressed because now every account has different password or passphrase, they all have more than 12 characters and I can easily change them without the fear that my memory will collapse.  The best part is I didn't put much effort nor did I need  much time for managing that. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
