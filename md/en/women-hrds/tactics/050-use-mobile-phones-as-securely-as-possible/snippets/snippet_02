A lot of WHRDs have received messages to their cell phones, and also their children have. For instance there is one HRD whose son was approached in a bus, and they wanted the cell phone. They took the cell phone, and they told him to give a message to his mother. Tell your mother that now we have all your contacts for your family. Those kinds of things – cell phones are really a weapon for them. — Anonymous Human rights Defender
