We're in the digital age and that's the most important means of communication. The postal services aren't even safe! But we call, we send emails, we send messages and that's how we communicate. If you can't protect that, you can't protect yourself, so it's best you're aware, informed, trained to be able to use these tools for your own benefit to protect yourself and protect your family. You're not only protecting yourself, you're protecting those you love. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
