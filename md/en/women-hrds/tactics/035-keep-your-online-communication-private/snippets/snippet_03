I love that encryption! I love it! The idea that you can relate with someone without a third party knowing what is happening, you can code your languages, your communication, wow! [...] I came to find that when we communicate with each other there is a Big Brother somewhere who somehow [can get] this information. Jitsi enables the coding of this information so even that Big Brother cannot decode it. It's useful because it makes your communication private, so it's just between you and the person you're addressing.  â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
