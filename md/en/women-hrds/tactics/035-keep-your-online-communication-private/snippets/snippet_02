Using GPG totally changed me. It is not just the feeling that I use the same tool that was used by someone so brave as to expose the NSA surveillance, but also knowing that someone could be annoyed just because they can't read my mails, or just making it harder for someone who can eventually decrypt them, apart from making me feel more secure, well it gives me great pleasure. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
