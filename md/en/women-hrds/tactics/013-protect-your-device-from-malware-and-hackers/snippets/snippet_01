Concerning viruses, one of the problems we face is that many people don't have anti-viruses up to date because they're pirated versions. I didn't know that Avira had the free antivirus. Viruses infected computers and destroyed many computers at the NGO, and the computers that got bad had many information in them, no way to recover it all. They are still stuck there and we hope that one day we will find the solution! And we have not done backup! So information loss is a threat. â€” Anonymous Human rights Defender
