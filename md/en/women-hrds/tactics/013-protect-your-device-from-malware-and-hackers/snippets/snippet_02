Viruses! That was what made us change... the viruses and the freedom of openoffice... because when you use Microsoft Office you have to pay a license. And the organisation doesn't have a regular income, so it's not easy to pay for the license. So, to avoid losing money which we don't have, better go to a software which is free. 

Each year we organise a conference with many workshops, we talk to people about the importance of using FOSS, we burn many versions of Ubuntu and distribute them on that day. â€”Anonymous Human Rights Defender from Cameroon
