title: How to Back up your Volume

---

Backing up your documents, files and folders on a regular basis is
critical. Backing up your **TrueCrypt** volume is vital, and (fortunately)
easy to do. Don't forget that your volume must be dismounted before you back it up.

**Step 1**. **Navigate** to your *Standard Volume* file (in *figure 1* below, it is located in the *My Documents* folder).

**Step 2**. **Save** the file to an external memory device, like a CD, DVD or a USB memory stick. 

**Tip**: If you have large amounts of data that you want to encrypt and archive repeatedly, why not create a new *Standard Volume* which is the same size as a CD or DVD? This could be used as a secure storage technique. 

Before you back up the standard volume to a removable device, make sure that the device size corresponds to the size of your volume.
