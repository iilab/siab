There are many different ways to classify viruses, and each of these methods comes with its own set of colorfully-named categories. Worms, macroviruses, trojans and backdoors are some of the more well-known examples. Many of these viruses spread over the Internet, using email, malicious webpages or other means to infect unprotected computers. Others spread through
removable media, particularly devices like USB memory sticks and
external hard drives that allow users to write information as well as
reading it. Viruses can destroy, damage or infect the information in
your computer, including data on external drives. They can also take
control of your computer and use it to attack other computers.
Fortunately there are many anti-virus tools that you can use to protect
yourself and those with whom you exchange digital information.

### Anti-virus software ###

There is an excellent [*freeware*](/en/glossary#Freeware)
anti-virus program for Windows called [*Avast*](/en/glossary#Avast), which is easy to use,
regularly updated and well-respected by anti-virus experts. It requires
that you register once every 14 months, but registration, updates and
the program itself are all free-of-charge.

There are various other well-known commercial anti-virus programs as alternatives to Avast. [*Clam Win*](/en/glossary#Clam_Win) is a [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) alternative to *[Avast](/en/glossary#Avast)*. Although it lacks certain features that are important for a primary anti-virus program, [*Clam Win*](/en/glossary#Clam_Win) has the advantage that it can be run from a USB memory stick in order to scan a computer on which you are not allowed to install software.

### Tips on using anti-virus software effectively ###

- Do not run two anti-virus programs at the same time, as this
might cause your computer to run extremely slowly or to crash. Uninstall
one before installing another. 
- Make sure that your anti-virus program allows you to
receive updates. Many commercial tools that come pre-installed on new
computers must be registered (and paid for) at some point or they will
stop receiving updates. All of the software recommended here supports
free updating. 
- Ensure that your anti-virus software updates itself
regularly. New viruses are written and distributed every day, and your
computer will quickly become vulnerable if you do not keep up with new
virus definitions. [*Avast*](/en/glossary#Avast) will automatically look for updates when you
are connected to the Internet. 
- Enable your anti-virus software's 'always on'
virus-detection feature if it has one. Different tools have different
names for it, but most of them offer a feature like this. It may be
called 'Realtime Protection,' 'Resident Protection,' or something
similar. Take a look at [***Section 3.2.1***](/en/howtouseavast#Section_3.2.1) of the [***Avast Guide***](/en/avast_main) to learn more about that tool's 'Resident Scanner.'
- Scan all of the files on your computer regularly. You don't have to do this
every day (especially if your anti-virus software has an 'always on'
feature, as described above) but you should do it from time to time.
How often may depend on the circumstances. Have you
connected your computer to unknown networks recently? With whom have
you been sharing USB memory sticks? Do you frequently receive strange
attachments by email? Has someone else in your home or office recently
had virus problems? For more information on how best to scan files, see the [***Avast Guide***](/en/avast_main).

### Preventing virus infection ###

- Be extremely cautious when opening email attachments, any files received (e.g. over Instant Messaging like MSN, Skype, etc.) or downloaded from the Internet.
It is best to avoid opening any files received from an unknown source.
If you need to do so, you should first save the attachment to a folder
on your computer, then open the appropriate application (such as
Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat) yourself. If you use the program's
File menu to open the attachment manually, rather than double-clicking
the file or allowing your email program to open it automatically, you
are less likely to contract a virus. 
- Consider the possible risks before inserting removable
media, such as CDs, DVDs and USB memory sticks, into your computer. You
should first check that your anti-virus program has the latest updates
and that its scanner is running. It is also a good idea to disable your
operating system's 'AutoPlay' feature, which can be used by viruses to infect
your computer. Under Windows XP, this can be done by going inside **My Computer**, right-clicking on your CD or DVD drive, selecting **Properties** and clicking on the **AutoPlay** tab. For each content type, select the **Take no action** or **Prompt me each time to choose an action** options then click **OK**. 
- You can also help prevent some virus infections by switching to free and
open source software, which is often more secure, and which virus
writers are less likely to target.

Assani: I have a virus cleaner and I run it regularly, so I figure my computer is healthy, right?

Salima: Actually, just having anti-virus software isn't enough. You also need to protect your computer from spyware and hackers, so you'll have to install and run a couple more tools.
