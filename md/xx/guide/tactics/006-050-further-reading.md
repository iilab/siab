- While it does not use secure deletion techniques to wipe them permanently, Firefox does provide a built-in way to clear many of its own temporary files. This feature is described in the [***Firefox Guide***](/en/firefox_main).
- The [CCleaner FAQ](http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/faq) provides additional information about installing and using the tool.
- Although much of the paper is quite technical, the introduction of Peter Guttmann's [Secure Deletion of Data from Magnetic and Solid-State Memory](http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sec96/full_papers/gutmann/) is worth reading, as the [method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutmann_method) he describes has had a major influence on the developers of *Eraser* and other secure file removal tools.
