---

You are now familiar with a few of the ways in which information might be exposed on your computer or storage device, even if you are dilligent about erasing sensitive files. You also know what tools you can use to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) that information permanently. There are a few simple steps that you should follow, especially if it is your first time using these tools, in order to ensure that your drive is cleaned safely and effectively:

- Create an encrypted backup of your important files, as discussed in [***Chapter 5: How to recover from information loss***](/en/chapter-5).
- Close down all unnecessary programs and disconnect from the Internet.
- Delete all unnecessary files, from all storage devices, and empty the **Recycle Bin**
- [*Wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) temporary files using [*CCleaner*](/en/glossary#CCleaner).
- [*Wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) the Windows [*swap file*](/en/glossary#Swap_file) using [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser).
- [*Wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) all of the free space on your computer and other storage devices using [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser). You might need to let this procedure run overnight, as it can be quite slow.

You should then get into the habit of:

- Periodically using [*CCleaner*](/en/glossary#CCleaner) to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) temporary files
- [*Wiping*](/en/glossary#Wiping) sensitive electronic documents using [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser), instead of using the **Recycle Bin** or the Windows delete function
- Periodically using [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser) to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) the Windows [*swap file*](/en/glossary#Swap_file)
- Periodically using [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser) to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) all unallocated space on your hard drives, USB memory sticks, and any other storage devices that may have had sensitive information deleted from them recently. This might include floppy disks, rewritable CDs, rewritable DVDs and removable flash memory cards from cameras, mobile phones or portable music players.
