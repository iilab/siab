We need to make informed decisions when using mobile phones, in order to protect ourselves, our contacts and our data. The way mobile phone networks and infrastructure work can significantly affect users' ability to keep information and communications private and secure.

* Mobile networks are private networks run by commercial entities, which can be under the monopoly control of the government. The commercial entity (or government), has practically unlimited access to the information and communications of customers, as well as the ability to intercept calls, text messages, and to monitor the location of each device (and therefore its user).

* The Operating Systems used on mobile devices themselves are custom-designed or configured by phone manufacturers according to the specifications of various service providers and for use on these companies' own networks. As a result, the OS may well include hidden features enabling better monitoring by the service provider of any particular device.

* The number of functions available on mobile phones has grown in the past few years. Modern mobile phones are in fact internet-connected portable mini-computers with mobile phone functions.

In order to work out which aspects of your communications most need to be protected, it may help to ask yourself a few questions: What is the content of your calls and text messages? With whom do you communicate, and when? Where are you calling from? Information is vulnerable in many ways:

* **Information is vulnerable when sent from a mobile phone **<br> Example: Each mobile phone provider has full access to all text and voice messages sent via its network. Phone providers in most countries are legally obliged to keep records of all communications. In some countries the phone providers are under the monopoly control of government. Voice and text communication can also be tapped by third parties in proximity to the mobile phone, using inexpensive equipment.

* **Information is vulnerable within the sender's and the recipient's phones**<br>  Example: Mobile phones can store all sorts of data: call history, text messages sent and received, address book information, photos, video clips, text files. These data may reveal your network of contacts, and personal information about you and your colleagues. Securing this information is difficult, even – on some phones – impossible.
Modern mobile phones are pocket-sized computers. With more features comes higher risk. In addition, phones that connect to the internet are also subject to the insecurities of computers and of the internet.

* **Phones give out information about their location**<br>  Example: As part of normal operation, every mobile phone automatically and regularly informs the phone service provider where it is at that moment. What's more, many phones nowadays have [GPS]](/en/glossary#GPS) functions, and this precise location information may be embedded in other data such as photos, SMS and internet requests that are sent from the phone.

**The evolution of technology brings more features, but also more risks.**

Borna:Son, I have decided only to use this mobile for planning our meetings from now on, because I think they might be listening to the factory floor phone, and maybe even at the house.

Delir: Father, it's great you have finally got a mobile phone, but do you know what it can and cannot do?

Borna: Of course: it is a phone! You call someone, you talk to them, they talk back. You can do this from wherever you are. AND, I can send small messages on it to the others, or to you, and they will show up in your phone.

Delir: This is all true, but it's not all. There are plenty of things you can do these days with these devices. But let's talk about some risks and safety precautions, especially if you think someone might be interested in finding out who you are communicating with, and what you are saying.

The following sections discuss a number of simple steps you can take to decrease the likelihood of security threats arising from using mobile devices.
