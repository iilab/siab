title: Protecting your information from physical intruders

---

Malicious individuals seeking access to your sensitive information
represent one important class of [*physical threat*](/en/glossary#Physical_threat). It would be a mistake
to assume that this is the only such threat to the security of your
information, but it would be even more shortsighted to ignore it.
There are a number of steps you can take to help reduce the risk of
physical intrusion. The categories and suggestions below, many of which
may apply to your home as well as your office, represent a foundation upon which you should build in accordance with your own particular physical security situation.



### Around the office ###

- Get to know your neighbours. Depending on the security climate
	in your country and in your neighbourhood, one of two things may be
	possible. Either you can turn them into allies who will help you keep
	an eye on your office, or you can add them to the list of potential
	threats that your security plan must address.
	
- Review how you protect all of the doors, windows and other points of entry that lead into your office.
	
- Consider installing a surveillance camera or a motion-sensor alarm.
	
- Try to create a reception area, where visitors can be met
	before they enter the office, and a meeting room that is separate from
	your normal work space.
	


### In the office ###

- Protect network cables by running them inside the office.
	
- Lock network devices such as [*servers*](/en/glossary#Server), [*routers*](/en/glossary#Router), [*switches*](/en/glossary#Router), [hubs](/en/glossary#Router)
	and modems into secure rooms or cabinets. An intruder with physical
	access to such equipment can install [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware) capable of stealing data
	in transit or attacking other computers on your network even after he
	leaves. In some circumstances it may be beneficial to hide servers, computers or other equipment in attics, over a fake ceiling, or even with a neighbor, and use them through wireless connection.
	
- If you have a wireless network, it is critical that you
	secure your [*access point*](/en/glossary#Router) so that intruders cannot join your network
	or monitor your traffic. If you are using an insecure wireless network, anyone in your neighbourhood with a laptop becomes a potential intruder. This is an unusual definition of 'physical', but it helps to consider that a malicious individual who can monitor your wireless network has the same access as one who can sneak into your office and connect an ethernet cable. The steps required
	to secure a wireless network will vary, depending on your [*access point*](/en/glossary#Router) hardware and software, but they are rarely difficult to follow.


### At your work ###

- You should position your computer screen carefully, both on
	your desk and when you are away from the office, in order to prevent
	others from reading what is displayed there. In the office, this means
	considering the location of windows, open doors and the guest waiting
	area, if you have one.
	
- Most desktop computer cases have a slot where you can attach
	a padlock that will prevent anyone without a key from getting inside.
	If you have cases like this in the office, you should lock them so that
	intruders cannot tamper with their internal hardware. You might also
	consider this feature when purchasing new computers.
	
- Use a locking [*security cable*](/en/glossary#Security_cable), where possible, to prevent
	intruders from stealing the computers themselves. This is especially
	important for laptops and small desktops that could be hidden inside a
	bag or under a coat.
	


### Software and settings related to physical security ###

- Make sure that, when you restart your computer, it asks you for a
	password before allowing you to run software and access files. If it
	does not, you can enable this feature in Windows by clicking on the *Start* menu, selecting the Control Panel, and double-clicking on User Accounts. In the User Accounts screen, select your own account and click Create a Password. Choose a secure password, as discussed in [***Chapter 3: How to create and maintain good passwords***](/en/chapter-3), enter your password, confirm it, click Create Password and click Yes, Make Private. 
- There are a few settings in your computer's [*BIOS*](/en/glossary#BIOS) that are relevant to physical security. First, you should configure
	your computer so that it will not *[boot](/en/glossary#Booting)* from the USB device, CD-ROM
	or DVD drives. Second, you should set a password on the [*BIOS*](/en/glossary#BIOS) itself, so that an
	intruder can not simply undo the previous setting. Again, be sure to choose a secure
	password.
- If you rely on a secure password database, as discussed in [***Chapter 3***](/en/chapter-3), to store your Windows or [*BIOS*](/en/glossary#BIOS) passwords for a particular computer, make sure that you do not keep your only copy of the database on that computer.
- Get in the habit of locking your account whenever you step away from your computer. On Windows, you can do this quickly by holding down the Windows logo key and pressing the L key. This will only work if you have created a password for your account, as described above. 
- [*Encrypt*](/en/glossary#Encryption) sensitive information on
	computers and storage devices in your office. See [***Chapter
	4: How to protect the sensitive files on your computer***](/en/chapter-4) for
	additional details and pointers to the appropriate Hands-on Guides.#

Rudo: I'm a bit nervous about messing around in BIOS. Can I break my computer if I do something wrong?

tto: You sure can, at least for a little while. In
fact, the settings that you might want to change are pretty simple, but
the BIOS screen itself can be a little intimidating, and it is possible
to leave your computer temporarily unable to start if you do something wrong. In general, if you're uncomfortable working in BIOS, you should ask someone with more
computer experience to help you out.

### Portable devices ### 

- Keep your laptop, your mobile phone and other portable devices
	that contain sensitive information with you at all times, especially if
	you are travelling or staying at a hotel. Travelling with a laptop
	[*security cable*](/en/glossary#Security_cable) is a good idea, although it is sometimes difficult to
	find an appropriate object to which you can attach one. Remember that
	meal times are often exploited by thieves, many of whom have learnt to
	check hotel rooms for laptops during hours of the day when they are
	likely to be unattended. 
- If you have a laptop, tablet or other mobile device, try to avoid putting them on
	display. There is no need to show thieves that you are carrying such
	valuable hardware or to show individuals who might want access to
	your data that your shoulder bag contains a hard drive full of
	information. Avoid using your portable devices in public areas, and
	consider carrying your laptop in something that does not look like a laptop bag.
