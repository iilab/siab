Spyware is a class of malicious software that can track the work you
do, both on your computer and on the Internet, and send 
information about it to someone who shouldn't have access to it. These programs
can record the words you type on your keyboard, the movements of your
mouse, the pages you visit and the programs you run, among other
things. As a result, they can undermine your computer's security and
reveal confidential information about you, your activities and your
contacts. Computers become infected with spyware in much the same way
that they contract viruses, so many of the suggestions above are also
helpful when defending against this second class of [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware). Because malicious webpages are a major source of spyware infection, you should pay extra attention to the websites you visit and
make sure that your browser settings are secure.

Assani: It all sounds like something out of a spy movie to me. Is my computer really &quot;infected with spyware?&quot;

Muhindo: Believe it or not, it's really common. If those programs you downloaded from the Internet haven't infected you, there's a good chance at least one of the webpages you've visited has. The fact that you use Windows and Internet Explorer makes it even more likely. If you've never scanned your computer for spyware, I
bet you'll be surprised by how much is already installed on it

### Anti-spyware software ###

You can use anti-spyware tools to protect your computer from this type
of threat. [*Spybot*](/en/glossary#Spybot) is one such program, and it does a very good job of
identifying and removing certain types of malware that anti-virus
programs simply ignore. Just like with anti-virus software, though, it
is extremely important that you update Spybot's [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware) definitions and
run regular scans.

Hands-on: Get started with the [*Spybot - Anti-Spyware Guide*](/en/spybot_main)

### Preventing spyware infection ###

- Stay alert when browsing websites. Watch for browser windows that appear automatically, and read them carefully instead of just clicking **Yes** or **OK**. When in doubt, you should close 'pop up
windows' by clicking the **X** in the upper right-hand corner, rather	than by  clicking **Cancel**. This can help prevent webpages from tricking you into installing [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware) on your computer. 
- Improve the security of your Web browser by preventing
it from automatically running the potentially dangerous programs that are sometimes contained within webpages you visit.	If you are using Mozilla [*Firefox*](/en/glossary#Firefox), you can install the [*NoScript*](/en/glossary#NoScript) add-on, as described in [***Section 4***](/en/firefox_noscript) of the [***Firefox Guide***](/en/firefox_main).
- Never accept and run this sort of content if it comes from websites that you don't know or trust.

Assani: I've heard that 'Java applets' and 'ActiveX controls' can be dangerous. But I have no idea what they are.

Salima: They're just different examples of the same sort of thing: small programs that your Web browser sometimes downloads along with whatever page you're reading.
Web designers use them to create complex sites, but they can also
spread viruses and spyware. You don't have to worry too much about how
they actually work, as long as you have NoScript installed and running properly.
