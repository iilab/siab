title: Keeping your software up-to-date

---

Computer programs are often large and complex. It is inevitable that
some of the software you use on a regular basis contains undiscovered
errors, and it is likely that some of these errors could undermine your
computer's security. Software developers continue to find these errors,
however, and release updates to fix them. **It is therefore essential
that you frequently update all of the software on your computer,
including the operating system.** If Windows is not updating itself automatically, you can configure it to do so by clicking the **Start** menu, selecting **All Programs** and clicking **Windows Update**. This will open Internet Explorer, and take you to the Microsoft Update page, where you can enable the **Automatic Updates** feature. See the [***Further reading***](/en/chapter_1_5) section to learn more about this. 

Similarly it is important to make sure that all of the other software installed on your computer is updated. In order to do it you first need to know what programs you have on your computer and perhaps uninstall those that are not essential (on Windows go to Control Panel and *Programs* or *Add/Remove Programs*). Then it is good to review for each program if it is the latest version, how can it be updated and will it update itself automatically in the future.

### Staying up-to-date with freeware and FOSS (free and open source software) tools ###

[*Proprietary software*](/en/glossary#Proprietary_software) often requires proof that it was purchased legally before it will allow
you to install updates. If you are using a pirated copy of Microsoft
Windows, for example, it may be unable to update itself, which would
leave you and your information extremely vulnerable. By not having a
valid license, you put yourself and others at risk. Relying on illegal
software can present non-technical risks, as well. The authorities in a growing number of countries have begun to verify that organisations
possess a valid license for each piece of software that they use.
Police have confiscated computers and closed down organizations on the
basis of 'software piracy.' This justification can be abused quite
easily in countries where the authorities have political reasons to
interfere with a given organisation's work. Fortunately, you do not
have to purchase expensive software to protect yourself from tactics
like this.

We strongly recommend that you try out the [*freeware*](/en/glossary#Freeware) or [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) (free and open source software) alternatives to any [*propriety  software*](/en/glossary#Proprietary_software) that
you currently use, especially those programs that are unlicensed. [*Freeware*](/en/glossary#Freeware) and [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) tools are often written by volunteers and non-profit organisations
who release them, and even update them, free of charge. [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) tools, in particular, are generally considered to be more secure than [*proprietary*](/en/glossary#Proprietary_software) ones, because they are developed in  a transparent way that allows their [*source
code*](/en/glossary#Source_code) to be examined by a diverse group of experts, any one of whom can
identify problems and contribute solutions.


Many [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) applications look like, and work almost the same way as, the
proprietary software that they were written to replace. At the same time,
you can use these programs alongside proprietary software, including
the Windows operating system, without any problems. Even if your
colleagues continue to use the commercial version of a particular type
of program, you can still exchange files and share information with
them quite easily. In particular, you might consider replacing Internet
Explorer, Outlook or Outlook Express and Microsoft Office with Firefox, Thunderbird and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), respectively.


In fact, you could even move away from the Microsoft Windows
operating system entirely, and try using a more secure [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) alternative called [*GNU/Linux*](/en/glossary#GNU_Linux). The best way to find out if you're ready to make the switch
is simply to give it a try. You can download a [*LiveCD*](/en/glossary#LiveCD) version of [*Ubuntu Linux*](http://www.ubuntu.com/),
burn it to a CD or DVD, put it in your computer and restart. When it's done
loading, your computer will be running [*GNU/Linux*](/en/glossary#GNU_Linux), and you can decide what you
think. Don't worry, none of this is permanent. When you're
finished, simply shut down your computer and remove the Ubuntu [*LiveCD*](/en/glossary#LiveCD). The next time you start up, you'll be back in Windows, and all
of you applications, settings and data will be just as you left them. In
addition to the general security advantages of open-source software,
Ubuntu has a free, easy-to-use update tool that will keep your operating
system and much of your other software from becoming outdated and insecure.
