title: Assessing your risks

---

Many organisations underestimate the importance of keeping their
offices and their equipment physically secure. As a result, they often
lack a clear policy describing what measures they should take to
protect computers and backup storage devices from theft, severe weather
conditions, accidents, and other [*physical threats*](/en/glossary#Physical_threat). The importance of
such policies may seem obvious, but formulating them properly can be
more complicated than it sounds. Many organisations, for example, have
good quality locks on their office doors, and many even have secure
windows; but if they do not pay attention to the number of keys that
have been created, and who has copies of those keys, their sensitive information
remains vulnerable.

Shingai: We want to put a brief summary of our security policy into
this grant application, but we also need to make sure the policy itself
is thorough. What should we include in it?

Otto: I'm afraid I can't recommend a one-size-fits-all solution to
the challenge of physical security. The specifics of a good policy
almost always depend on a particular organisation's individual
circumstances. Here's a piece of general advice, though: when you're
trying to come up with a plan, you need to observe your work
environment very carefully and think creatively about where your weak
points might be and what you can do to strengthen them.

When assessing the risks and vulnerabilities that you or your
organisation face, you must evaluate several different levels at which
your data may be threatened.

- Consider the communication channels you use and how you use
	them. Examples might include paper letters, faxes, landline phones,
	mobile phones, emails and [*Skype*](/en/glossary#Skype) messages.
	
- Consider how you store important information. Computer hard
	drives, email and web servers, USB memory sticks, external USB hard
	drives, CDs and DVDs, mobile phones, printed paper and hand-written
	notes are all likely possibilities.
	
- Consider where these items are located, physically. They
	could be in the office, at home, in a trash bin out back or,
	increasingly, 'somewhere on the Internet.' In this last case, it might be quite challenging to to determine the particular piece of information's actual, physical location.


Keep in mind that the same piece of information might be
vulnerable on many different levels. Just as you might rely on
anti-virus software to protect the contents of a USB memory stick from
[*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware), you must rely on a detailed physical security plan to protect
the same information from theft, loss or destruction. While some
security practices, such as having a good off-site backup policy, are
helpful against both digital and physical threats, others are clearly
more specific.


When you decide whether to carry your USB memory stick in your
pocket or sealed in a plastic bag at the bottom of your luggage, you are
making a decision about physical security, even though the information
you are trying to protect is digital. As usual, the correct policy depends greatly on the situation. Are you walking across town or
travelling across a border? Will somebody else be carrying your bag? Is
it raining? These are the sorts of questions that you should consider when
making decisions like this.
