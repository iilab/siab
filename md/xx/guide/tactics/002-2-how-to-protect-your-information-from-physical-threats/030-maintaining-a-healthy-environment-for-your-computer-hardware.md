title: Maintaining a healthy environment for your computer hardware

---

Like many electronic devices, computers are quite sensitive. They do
not adapt well to unstable electricity supplies, extreme temperatures, dust,
high humidity or mechanical stress. There are a number of things you
can do to protect your computers and network equipment from such
threats:

- Electrical problems such as power surges, blackouts and brownouts
	can cause physical damage to a computer. Irregularities like this can 'crash' your hard drive, damaging the information it contains,
	or physically harm the electronic components in your computer.
	
	- If you can afford them, you should install *Uninterruptible
		Power Supplies* ([*UPS'*](/en/glossary#UPS)) on important computers in your office. A [*UPS*](/en/glossary#UPS) stabilises electricity supply and provides temporary power in the event of a blackout.
		
	- Even where [*UPS'*](/en/glossary#UPS) are deemed inappropriate or too costly, you
		can still provide power filters or surge protectors, either of
		which will help protect you from power surges.
		
	- Test your electrical network before you connect important
		equipment to it. Try to use power sockets that have three slots,
		one of them being a 'ground line', or 'earth'. And, if possible, take a day or two to
		see how the electrical system in a new office behaves when powering inexpensive
		devices, such as lamps and fans, before putting your computers at risk.
		
- To defend against accidents in general, avoid
	placing important hardware in passages, reception areas or other easily
	accessible locations. UPS', power filters, surge protectors, power
	strips and extension cables, particularly those attached to servers and
	networking equipment, should be positioned where they will not be
	switched off by an accidental misstep.
	
- If you have access to high-quality computer cables, power
	strips and extension cables, you should purchase enough to serve your
	entire office and pick up a few extras. Power strips that fall out
	of wall sockets, fail to hold plugs securely and spark constantly are
	more than just annoying. They can be quite damaging to the physical
	security of any computers attached to them. They can also lead frustrated users to secure their loose computer cables to a sparking
	power strip with tape, which creates an obvious fire hazard.
	
- If you keep any of your computers inside cabinets, make sure they have adequate ventilation, or they might overheat
- Computer equipment should not be housed near radiators, heating vents, air conditioners or other ductwork
