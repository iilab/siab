In order to send or receive any calls or communications to your phone, the signal towers nearest you are alerted by your phone of its presence. As a result of those alerts and communications the network service provider knows the precise geographic location of your mobile phone at any given time.

Borna: Is there anything else about this phone that I need to know?

Delir: I guess yes, but it depends if you really suspect they are trying to track you down.

Borna: I don't think so, but can they do that? 

Delir: Well, yes, if you have your phone turned on, AND the technician has access to the network traffic, AND they know which phone on the system is your phone.

Borna: That won't happen because I simply won't make a call on my phone when I go there.

Delir: That doesn't matter father. As long as you have your phone with you, charged and ready to use, it will keep track of where you go, and talk to the towers of the network nearby, simply because it has to. So at any given time, your location is somewhere between the closest towers of the phone network.

Borna: So I should turn it off until I get there?

Delir: Well, of course the best thing to do is not to take it with you. The next best thing is for you to have it switched off AND take the battery out of it before you go, and not turn it on until you get back.

Borna: What? isn't it enough to turn it off?

Delir: Well, to be on the safe side, you should take the battery out, and here's why: this is a transmission device, and as long as the battery is connected, there is a small chance that somehow someone may turn it on without your knowledge.

**About Anonymity**

If you are conducting sensitive phone conversations or sending sensitive SMS messages, beware of the above tracking 'feature' of all mobile phones. Consider adopting the steps below:

* Make calls from different locations each time, and choose locations that are not associated with you.

* Keep your phone turned off, with the battery disconnected, go to the chosen location, switch your phone on, communicate, switch the phone off and disconnect the battery. Doing this habitually, each time you have to make a call, will mean that the network cannot track your movements.

* Change phones and [SIM cards](/en/glossary#SIM_card) often. Rotate them between friends or the second-hand market. 

* Use unregistered pre-paid SIM cards if this is possible in your area. 
Avoid paying for a phone or SIM cards using a credit card, which will also create a connection between these items and you.

Borna: You're telling me my phone might be talking to the towers about my whereabouts, even it looks as though it's switched off?

Delir: Yeah, and that is not the worst case

Borna: Oh?

Delir: Well, they are saying that there are programs that can be installed on your phone to secretly, remotely turn it on, and have it call a number without your knowledge. Then, as you start your meeting, it would start acting like a recording and transmitting device.

Borna: No! really?.

Delir: Well, it is pretty easily done technologically. But none of that can happen if the battery is disconnected, so you will be safe in this unlikely case.

Borna: I guess I will just not take it with me if I want to be super careful. But I wonder if I should use this thing at all then?

Delir: Please, father. You used to tell me not to be afraid of new things. Mobiles are like that, you just have to know what the benefits and risks are. Just be careful. If you know the risks, you can take steps to avoid them.

**About eavesdropping**

Your phone can be set to record and transmit any sounds within the range of its microphone without your knowledge. Some phones can be switched on remotely and brought into action in this way, even when they look as though they are switched off. 

* Never let people whom you don't trust get physical access to your phone; this is a common way of installing spying software on your phone.

* If you are conducting private and important meetings, switch your phone off and disconnect the battery. Or don't carry the phone with you if you can leave it where it will be absolutely safe. 

* Make sure that any person with whom you communicate also employs the safeguards described here.

* In addition, don't forget that using a phone in public, or in places that you don't trust, makes you vulnerable to traditional eavesdropping techniques, or to having your phone stolen.

**About interception of calls**

Typically, encryption of voice communications (and of text messages) that travel through the mobile phone network is relatively weak. There are inexpensive techniques which third parties can use to intercept your written communications, or to listen to your calls, if they are in proximity to the phone and can receive transmissions from it. And of course, mobile phone providers have access to all your voice and text communications. It is currently expensive and/or somewhat technically cumbersome to encrypt phone calls so that even the mobile phone provider can't eavesdrop â€“ however, these tools are expected to become cheaper soon. To deploy the encryption you would first have to install an encryption application on your phone, as well as on the device of the person with whom you plan to communicate. Then you would use this application to send and receive encrypted calls and/or messages. Encryption software is currently only supported on a few models of so-called 'smart' phones.

Conversations between Skype and mobile phones are not encrypted either, since at some point, the signal will move to the mobile network, where encryption is NOT in place.
