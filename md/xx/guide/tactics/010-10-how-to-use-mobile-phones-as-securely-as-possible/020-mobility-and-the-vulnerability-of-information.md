title: Mobility and the vulnerability of information

---

People often carry mobile phones that contain sensitive information. Communications history, text and voice messages, address books, calendar, photos and many other useful phone functions can become highly compromising if the phone or the data is lost or stolen. It is vital to be aware of the information that is stored, both actively and passively, on your mobile phone. Information stored on a phone could implicate the person using the phone as well as everyone in their address book, message inbox, photo album, etc. 

Mobile phones that connect to the internet are also subject to the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the internet and computers, as discussed in the other chapters of this book regarding information security, anonymity, information retrieval, loss, theft and interception.

In order to reduce some of these security risks, users should be aware of their phone's potential for insecurity, as well as its set-up options. Once you know what the possible problems may be, you can put safeguards into place and take preventative measures.

Borna: One advantage to the mobile phone is that they won't know where our meetings are if we organise them using our mobiles, while walking in the bazaar, instead of using the normal phones, where they may be overhearing us as we talk.
 
Delir: Well, did you say they have connections with the phone company?

Borna: Someone was saying that they are bribing phone technicians to get information.

Delir: If you signed up using your own identity and address for this mobile phone subscription, it is traceable to you, and any time you make a call, its record is linked to your phone subscription and identity. Did you sign up with your own ID?

Borna: No, I just got a second-hand phone from your uncle's shop; he says he made sure it is clean and safe to use. He also helped me buy one of those prepaid little chips you put in your phone.

Delir: Yes, it is called a [SIM card](/en/glossary#SIM_card). The phone company tracks each call or transmission with the phone's number, and the SIM card identification number, AND the phone's identification number. So if they know which phone number, OR phone id number, OR SIM card number belongs to you, they may be able to use their contacts to see your phone-use patterns.

Borna: And I suppose they can listen in to my conversations even on my mobile phone then?

Delir: In your case, and thanks to Uncle, your phone isn't registered to you, and the SIM card is also not connected to you in any way. So even if they track where the SIM card and the phone are they don't necessarily know you are connected to the SIM card, or to the phone.
