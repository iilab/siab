title: 7. How to keep your Internet communication private

---

The convenience, cost-effectiveness and flexibility of email and instant messaging make them extremely valuable for individuals and organizations with even the most limited access to the Internet. For those with faster and more reliable connections, software such as [*Jitsi*](https://jitsi.org/), [*Skype*](/en/glossary#Skype) and other *Voice-over-IP* [*VoIP*](/en/glossary#VoIP) tools also share these characteristics. Unfortunately, these digital alternatives to traditional means of communication can not always be relied upon to keep sensitive information private. Of course, this is nothing new. Postal mail, telephone calls and text messages are all vulnerable as well, particularly when used by those who may have been targeted for surveillance by the authorities. 

One important difference between digital, Internet-based communication techniques and more traditional methods, is that the former often allow you to determine your own level of security. If you send emails, instant messages and [*VoIP*](/en/glossary#VoIP) conversations using insecure methods, they are almost certainly less private than letters or telephone calls. In part, this is because a few powerful computers can automatically
search through a large amount of digital information to identify senders,
recipients and specific key words. Greater resources are required to carry out the same level of surveillance on traditional communication channels. However, if you take certain precautions, the opposite can be true. The flexibility of Internet communication tools and the strength of modern [*encryption*](/en/glossary#Encryption) can now provide a level of privacy that was once available only to national military and intelligence organizations.

By following the guidelines and exploring the software discussed in this chapter, you can greatly improve your communication security. The [*RiseUp*](/en/glossary#RiseUp)  email service, the Off the Record [*OTR*](/en/glossary#OTR) plugin for the [*Pidgin*](/en/glossary#Pidgin)  instant messaging program, Mozilla [*Firefox*](/en/glossary#Firefox)  and the [*Enigmail*](/en/glossary#Enigmail) add-on for the Mozilla [*Thunderbird*](/en/glossary#Thunderbird)  email client are all excellent tools. While using them, however, you should keep in mind that the privacy of a given conversation is never one hundred percent guaranteed. There is always some threat that you did not consider, be it a [*keylogger*](/en/glossary#Keylogger) on your computer, a person listening at the door, a careless email correspondent or something else entirely. The goal of this chapter is to help you reduce even the threats that do not occur to you, while avoiding the extreme position, favoured by some, that you should not send anything over the Internet
that you are not willing to make public.

Claudia and Pablo work with a human rights NGO in
a South American country. After spending several months collecting
testimonies from witnesses to the human rights violations that have
been committed by the military in their region, Claudia and Pablo have begun taking steps to protect the resulting data. They have kept only the information they need, which they store in a TrueCrypt partition that is backed up in several physical locations. While preparing to publish certain aspects of these testimonies in a report, they have found that they must discuss sensitive information with a few of their colleagues in another country. Although they have agreed not to mention names or locations, they still want to ensure that their email and instant messaging conversations on this topic remain private. After calling a meeting to discuss the importance of communication security, Claudia has asked if anyone in the office has questions.
