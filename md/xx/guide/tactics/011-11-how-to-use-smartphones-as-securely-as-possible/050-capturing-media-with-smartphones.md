title: Capturing Media with Smartphones

---

Capturing pictures, video or audio with your smartphone can be a powerful means to document and share important events. However, it is important to be careful and respectful of privacy and safety of those pictured, filmed or recorded. For example, if you take photos or record video or audio of an important event, it might be dangerous to you or to those who appear in the recordings, if your phone fell into the wrong hands. In this case, these suggestions may be helpful:

- Have a mechanism to securely upload recorded media files to protected online location and remove them from the phone instantly (or as soon as you can) after recording.

- Use tools to blur the faces of those appearing in the images or videos or distort the voices of audio or videos recordings and store only blurred and distorted copies of media files on your mobile device.

- Protect or remove meta information about time and place within the media files.

[**Guardian Project**](https://guardianproject.info) has created a [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) app called [**ObscuraCam**](https://guardianproject.info/apps/obscuracam/) to detect faces on photos and blur them. You can choose the blurring mode and what to blur, of course. Obscuracam also deletes the original photos and if you have set up a server to upload the captured media, it provides easy functionality to upload it.

At the time of writing, the human rights organisation [**Witness**](www.witness.org) is working with the Guardian project on a solution to all three of the above points.
