title: Sending Emails from Smartphones

---

In this section we will briefly discuss the use of email on smartphones. We encourage you to refer to sections [***Securing your email***](/en/chapter_7_1) and [***Tips on responding to suspected email surveillance***](/en/chapter_7_2) in [***Chapter 7: How to keep your Internet communication private***](/en/chapter-7) where we discuss basic email security.

In the first instance, consider if you really need to use your smartphone to access your email. Securing a computer and its content is generally simpler than doing so for a mobile device such as a smartphone. A smartphone is more susceptible to theft, monitoring and intrusion. 

If it is absolutely vital that you access your email on your smartphone, there are actions you can take to minimize the risks. 

- Do not rely on smartphone as your primary means for accessing your email. Downloading (and removing) emails from an email server and storing them only on your smartphone is not advised. You can set up your email application to use only copies of emails.

- If you use email encryption with some of your contacts, consider installing it on your smartphone, too. The additional benefit is that encrypted emails will remain secret if the phone falls into wrong hands.

Storing your private encryption key on your mobile device may seem risky. But the benefit of being able to send and store emails securely encrypted on the mobile device might outweigh the risks. Consider creating a mobile-only encrytpion key-pair (using [**APG**](/en/APG_main)) for your use on your smartphone, so you do not copy your encryption private key from your computer to the mobile device. Note that this requires that you ask people you communicate with to also encrypt emails using your mobile-only encryption key.
