title: 11. How to use smartphones as securely as possible

---

In [***Chapter 10: How to use mobile phones as securely as possible***](/en/chapter-10), we discussed the security challenges of using basic mobile phones – including issues with voice communication and text messaging (SMS/MMS) services. Those phones primarily (if not exclusively) use mobile networks to transfer calls and data.

Advances in technology now mean that mobile phones can provide services and features similar to desktop or laptop computers. These smartphones offer many new ways to communicate and capture and disseminate media. To provide these new functionalities, the smartphones not only use the mobile network, but also connect to the internet either via a wifi connection (similar to a laptop at an internet cafe) or via data connections through the mobile network operator.

So while you can, of course, make phone calls with a smartphone, it is better to view smartphones as small computing devices. This means that the other material in this toolkit is relevant to your use of your smartphone as well as your computer.

Smartphones usually support a wide range of functionality – web browsing, email, voice and instant messaging over the internet, capturing, storing and transmitting audio, videos and photos, enabling social networking, multi-user games, banking and many other activities. However, many of these tools and features introduce new security issues, or increase existing risks. 

For instance, some smartphones have built-in geo-location ([*GPS*](/en/Glossary#GPS)) functionality, which means they can provide your precise location to your mobile network operator by default, and to many applications you use on your phone (such as social networking, mapping, browsing and other applications). As mentioned before, mobile phones already relay your location information to your mobile network operator (as part of the normal functions of the phone). However, the additional GPS functionality not only increases the precision of your location information, it also increases the amount of places where this information might be distributed.

It's worth reviewing all the risks associated with mobile phones discussed in [***Chapter 10: How to use mobile phones as securely as possible***](/en/chapter-10) as all of them are also relevant to smartphone use. [***Chapter 10***](/en/chapter-10) covers issues of eavesdropping, interception of SMS or phone calls, SIM card related issues, and best practices.

In this chapter we'll take a look at the additional security challenges posed by smartphones.

### Purses, Wallets,  Smartphones ###

We have an intuitive understanding of the value of keeping our purse or wallet safe, because so much sensitive information is stored in them, and losing them will compromise our privacy and safety.  People are less aware of the amount of personal information being carried in their smartphones, and consider losing a phone a nuisance rather than a risk. If you also think that a smartphone is a computing device which is always connected to a network and is continually carried around, it also highlights the important difference between a holder of discrete, passive information (like a wallet), and an active and interactive item like a smartphone.

A simple exercise can help illustrate this:

Empty the content of your wallet or purse, and take account of sensitive items. Typically you may find:
- Pictures of loved ones (~5 pictures)
- Identification cards (driver's license, membership cards, social security cards)
- Insurance and health information  (~2 cards)
- Money (~5 bills)
- Credit/Debit cards (~3 cards)

Now, examine the contents of your smartphone. A typical smartphone user may find some of the above in higher quantities, and in some cases much more valuable items:

- Pictures of loved ones (~100 pictures)
- Email applications and their passwords
- Emails (~500 emails)
- Videos (~50 videos)
- Social networking applications and their passwords
- Banking applications (with access to the bank accounts)
- Sensitive documents
- Sensitive communication records
- A live connection to your sensitive information 

The more you use smartphones, the more you need to become aware of the associated risks and take appropriate precautions. Smartphones are powerful amplifiers and distributors of your personal data. They are designed to provide as much connectivity as possible and to link to social networking services by default. This is because your personal data is valuable information that can be aggregated, searched and sold. 

In [***Chapter 5: How to recover from information loss***](/en/chapter-5) we discussed the importance of backing up data. This applies in particular to smartphones. It can be disastrous if you lose your phone without having a backup of your most important data (such as your contacts) in a secure location. Besides backing up your data, make sure you also know how to restore the data. Keep a hard copy of the steps you need to take so you can do it quickly in an emergency.

In this chapter we'll start by introducing some smartphone basics – a description of various platforms and some basic setup procedures for securing your information and communication. The remaining parts of this chapter will cover specific precautions related to common uses of smartphones. Subsequent sections will cover security aspects of the following:
