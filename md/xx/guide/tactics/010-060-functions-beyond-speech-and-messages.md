Mobile phones are turning into mobile computing devices, complete with their own operating systems and downloadable applications that provide various services to the user. 

[***Chapter 11: How to use smartphones as securely as possible***](/en/chapter-11) covers issues related to these kinds of mobile devices, as connectivity to internet brings about both potentials as well as risks we have covered in previous chapters.

â€¨While some of the earlier mobile phone models have fewer or no internet functions, it is nevertheless important to observe the precautions outlined below on all phones. Also you should find out exactly what the capabilities of your phone are, in order to be certain that you have taken appropriate measures:

* Do not store confidential files and photos on your mobile phone. Move them, as soon as you can, to a safe location, as discussed in [***Chapter 4: How to Protect Files on Your Computer***](/en/chapter-4).

* Frequently erase your phone call records, messages, address book entries, photos, etc.

* If you use your phone to browse the internet, follow safe practices similar to those you use when you are on the computer (e.g. always send information over encrypted connection like [HTTPS](/en/glossary#SSL)).

* Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free. See [***Chapter 1: How to Protect Your Computer From Malware and Hackers***](/en/chapter-1).

* Do not accept and install unknown and unverified programmes on your phone, including ring tones, wallpaper, [java applications](/en/glossary#Java) or any others that originate from an unwanted and unexpected source. They may contain viruses, malicious software or spying programmes.

* Observe your phone's behaviour and functioning. Look out for unknown programmes and running processes, strange messages and unstable operation. If you don't know or use some of the features and applications on your phone, disable or uninstall them if you can.

* Be wary when connecting to WiFi access points that don't provide passwords, just as you would when using your computer and connecting to WiFi access points. The mobile phone is essentially like a computer and thus shares the vulnerabilities and insecurities that affect computers and the internet.

* Make sure communication channels like [Infrared (IrDA)](/en/glossary#IrDA), [Bluetooth](/en/glossary#Bluetooth) and Wireless Internet (WiFi) on your phone are switched off and disabled if you are not using them. Switch them on only when they are required. Use them only in trusted situations and locations. Consider not using Bluetooth, as it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on this form of communication. Instead, transfer data using a cable connection from the phone to handsfree headphones or to a computer.
