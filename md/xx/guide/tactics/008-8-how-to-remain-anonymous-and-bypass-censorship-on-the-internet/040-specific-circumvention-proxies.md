**Psiphon1** may be a good option if you know someone who has a Windows computer that she leaves on, running and connected to a fast, unfiltered Internet connection in another country. In order to use [*Psiphon*](/en/glossary#Psiphon), you must ask this person to download the program from the [*Civisec webpage*](http://psiphon.civisec.org/), install it, create an account for you, and send you the [*proxy's*](/en/glossary#Proxy) [*IP address*](/en/glossary#IP_address) along with your username and password. This will give you access to your own personal account on a trusted, secure, private, web-based circumvention [*proxy*](/en/glossary#Proxy). Before using it, however, you should verify the  [*proxy's*](/en/glossary#Proxy) fingerprint as discussed in the  [*Secure and insecure proxies*](/en/chapter_8_3#Secure_and_insecure_proxies) section, above, and in *Appendix C* of the included [*Psiphon User's Guide*](/en/glossary#Psiphon_users_guide).
