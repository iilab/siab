## 4.0 How to Change Your Account Settings ##

**RiseUp** lets you modify different settings for your account. You can specify the size of your email box, change your account name and address, add aliases and much more. You can also
create invite codes to help your friends and colleagues register their own **RiseUp** account. 

**Step 1**. **Open** the **RiseUp** *Account Settings* page as follows: [**https://user.riseup.net/**](https://user.riseup.net/)

*Figure 1: The user.riseup.net page*

**Step 2**. **Type** in your username and password into their corresponding text fields.

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/22.png) to open the following screen:

### 4.1 The My Settings page ###

The *My Settings* page displays all the information that you originally entered in the [**Create a RiseUp Account**](/riseup_createaccount) page. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/24.png) to open the following screen:

![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/25.png)

*Figure 3: The Settings page*

You can change your username on this screen, which will also change your email address. The new username should also be unique. Here you may also change any other account details such as the alternate email, password and so on. 

**Note** that the fields *Language*, *Country* and *Time Zone* should not be changed to minimise amount of personal information that you store on the server.

**Step 2**. **Type** in your new information, then **click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/26.png) to display this message:

## 4.2 The Email settings page ##

The *Email settings* page lets you modify or view information related to email storage. You can even set the 'quota' or amount of space reserved for your email account on a **RiseUp** server. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/28.png) to open the following screen:

![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/29.png)

*Figure 5: The Email settings page*

**Step 2**. **Enter** an appropriate number into the *Quota* text field. 

**Note**: Your account is limited in size to a maximum of your disk quota (by default it is 92 MB at this moment). If you need more space, consider downloading your email using a mail client like Thunderbird, and do not keep them on the server.

You may also create aliases for your account on this page. An alias is like a nickname for your account. Whilst the main account will remain as before, people will be able to send email to your alias address as well.

*Figure 6: The Aliases section of the Email settings page*

*Example*: **ssayyedd@riseup.net** account now has two aliases. Email sent to **safeandsecure@riseup.net** and **salsaytest@riseup.net** will be forwarded to the main account. This maybe a useful practice to keep your real account address private.

**Note** There are other configuration settings available on this page which you access from the tabs and links as shown on figure 5. Some of them are:

* *Spam settings* : Allows you to configure how a RiseUp server will manage suspected spam (unwanted emails);
* *Mail filters* : Allows you to configure a RiseUp server to sort your incoming emails into different folders or delete specific emails;
* *Fix mailbox* : Can help in a situation where your mailbox stops working; 
* *Restore mail from backups* : Can restore your mailbox content from a backup stored on a RiseUp server;
* *Destroy mailbox* : Will remove your mailbox completely, along with all emails in all folders. You will be able to log in to this account again and create an new (empty) mailbox.


**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/26.png) to save your new settings.

## 4.3 The Invites page ##

The *Invites* page lets you generate *invite codes* that are used to invite your friends and colleagues to join **RiseUp**. 

**Important**: Each new account needs an invite code from two different users. You may generate as many invite codes as you wish. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/31.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/32.png)

![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/34.png)

*Figure 8: An example of generated invite codes*

**Note**: Each invite code is valid for one month.

**Step 3**. **Click** ![Print invites](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/35.png) to print out a copy of the invite codes and give them to the person wishing to create a **RiseUp** email account.

**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/36.png) to log out of the user panel.
