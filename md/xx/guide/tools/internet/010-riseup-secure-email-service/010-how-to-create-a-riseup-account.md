title: How to Create a RiseUp Account

---

**RiseUp** offers you two different methods for registering an email account. Each method requires a different investment of effort and time. 

1). Directly request an account from the **RiseUp** team themselves. Bear in mind that **RiseUp** generally runs on donations and the enthusiasm and goodwill of its volunteers - this method can take longer to be approved for an account.  

2). The recommended method is for individuals and/or organisations to be invited to join by two existing **RiseUp** account members. This method requires that each existing **RiseUp** member sends you an invite code. To see how such codes are generated, please refer to [**Section 4.3 The Invites Page**](/en/riseup_changingsettings#4.3) 

After you have received your invite codes, perform the following steps to register your free **RiseUp** account as follows: 

**Step 1**. **Type** [**https://mail.riseup.net**](https://mail.riseup.net) into your web browser, to activate the **RiseUp** site as follows:

*Figure 1: The https://mail.riseup.net/ page*

**Note**: The ***s*** in the *http**s**://* address indicates that you are now communicating through a **Secure Sockets Layer** (**SSL**) connection. 

For more information about this, please refer to the **How-to Booklet** chapter [**7. Keeping your Internet Communication Private**](/chapter-7) or to [**https://help.riseup.net/security**](https://help.riseup.net/security).

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/03.png) to activate the *Request account* page as follows:

![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/04.png)

*Figure 2: The RiseUp Request an email account page*

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/05.png) to display the **RiseUp** *Request an email account - About our email service* page.

**Important**: You *must* agree to all terms and conditions stated on the *About our email service* page to proceed with the **RiseUp** account setup. 

**Step 4**. Read the **RiseUp** *Social Contract*, *Privacy Policy* and *Terms of Service*. **Click** all the *I accept riseup.net's* check boxes to confirm that you agree to the terms and conditions.  

**Step 5**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/05.png) to begin creating your **RiseUp** account by filling out the following on-line forms: *Account information*, *Password* and *Activation*.

**Step 6**. **Enter** a desired username for your account. This will become your login and your email address. (In this tutorial, we based our example on 'ssayyed' to generate an email account known as [**ssayyed@riseup.net**](mailto:ssayyed@riseup.net). 

**Important**: Do not use commas, full stops or spaces in the username.

*Figure 3: An example of a completed Account information form*

**Note** that the fields *Alternate email*, *Language*, *Country* and *Time Zone* are not changed or they are left empty, to minimise the amount of personal information that you store on the server. Leaving *Alternate email* field empty will provide better privacy, but will not let you reset your password for this account in case you forget it.

**Step 7**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/05.png) to proceed to the *Password* form. 

**Note**: If you chosen username is already taken, you will be prompted to create a different one.

**Step 8**. **Fill-in** the *Password* and *Retype password* fields and **click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/05.png) to proceed.

**Important:** The password for your **RiseUp** account is the most important factor in the security of your account. To learn how to create a strong password, please refer to the How-to Booklet chapter [**3. How to Create and Maintain Good Passwords**](/en/chapter-3) and to the manual on [**KeePass**](/en/keepass_main).

**Step 9**.  Complete the *Activation* form.

If you have received Invite codes from **RiseUp** account users that you know personally, **type** the Invite codes into their respective fields. Each Invite code much come from a different user. Alternatively you can request an account by **RiseUp.net** by completing the *Tell us about yourself* field. If you provide Invite codes, do not fill in the *Tell us about yourself* field.
 
**Type** the *Invite codes* into their respective text fields.
