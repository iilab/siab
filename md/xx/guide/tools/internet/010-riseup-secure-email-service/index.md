**Alternative Email Services:**

Although **RiseUp** is a secure email service managed by trustworthy advocates of Internet privacy and security, an unusual email service may attract unwarranted attention. It might make more sense in some situations, to blend in by using a popular email service in your country. The goal is to make this decision without compromising your minimum security requirements. We offer the following points for consideration when choosing an email service:

1. Does it permit the **use of encrypted channels** (like *https*, and other SSL encrypted versions of protocols like IMAPs, POP3s, SMTPs) for transferring all information (including login-in information, and your emails), and are there any encryption-related problems (for example, problems related to encryption certificates)?

2. Are the **email servers managed in secure way?** Are they run by professionals who are committed to using the best practices for protecting your information? Do you trust they will *not* provide access to your information, for *any* reason (commercial, political, religious, etc.), to third parties?

3. Do you know the geographical location of the servers, **under which territorial jurisdiction they fall** or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information?

In some parts of the world, **Google Mail** would prove a good alternative to **RiseUp**,  offering a better "blending in" effect, without compromising much of the security (given its commercial nature).


### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

**RiseUp** is a collective dedicated to providing private and secure hosting, listing and mail services for individuals and organisations who are committed to political and social justice. As their services are free and Riseup is not monitoring your activity, your email account is much smaller than other advertisement-driven and non-secure providers. A new account can only be registered by those who have received an invite code from two existing members. Read [more about Riseup on their website](https://help.riseup.net/en/about-us).

**RiseUp** operates exclusively over the **Secure Sockets Layer** (**SSL**), providing a secure connection between your computer and their server. This security is maintained when reading your email in a client program, over secure **POP**, **IMAP** and **SMTP** connections (these refer to protocols used by a email client program to download or send your emails). **RiseUp** is compatible with **Mozilla Thunderbird**. To learn how to set up **Mozilla Thunderbird** to access your **RiseUp** email account, please refer to the chapter on [**Thunderbird**](http://securityinabox.org/en/thunderbird_main).

In addition to email accounts **RiseUp** also provides: 

- [**Mailing Lists**](https://lists.riseup.net/) for email group communication;
- [**CrabGrass**](https://we.riseup.net/) its own free and open source social networking application, designed for group and network organizing and tailored to the needs of the global justice movement;
- [**EtherPad**](https://pad.riseup.net/) collaborative document editing platform, where multiple users can edit the same document at the same time;
- [**OpenVPN**](https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn) an encrypted Internet proxy, which allows browsing the Internet through **RiseUp** servers. For more information about proxies refer to chapter [8. How to remain anonymous and bypass censorship on the Internet](/en/chapter-8);
- [**Jabber/XMPP**](https://help.riseup.net/en/chat) instant messaging, text, voice and video chat server. You can make use of this server with programs such as [Jitsi](/en/jitsi), [Pidgin](/en/pidgin_main), Adium, and ChatSecure among others. Also refer to section [Securing other Internet communication tools](/en/chapter_7_3) or chapter [7. How to keep your Internet communication private](/en/chapter-7).
