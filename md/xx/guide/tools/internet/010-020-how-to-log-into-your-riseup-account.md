## 3.1 How to Use the Virtual Keyboard ##

If you are using a public or shared computer (for example in an Internet caf√©, community centre or library), you can enter your password by using the **virtual keyboard**. It offers your email account another layer of protection from *key-logger* programs. Key-logger programs are designed to monitor user's physical key strokes to record passwords, usernames and other vital information. Virtual keyboard allow users to circumvent this security vulnerability, by letting the user enter their password using the mouse. 

To use the **RiseUp** *virtual keyboard*, perform the following steps: 

**Step 1**. **Open** the **RiseUp** home page [**https://mail.riseup.net/**](https://mail.riseup.net/).

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/riseup-en-1/18.png) to activate virtual keyboard as follows:

**Step 3**. To enter your password, use your mouse to **click** the on screen keys. You can select a language for the *virtual keyboard* by accessing the pull-down menu on the top-left of the keyboard. You may need to use "Alt" or "AlrGr" buttons to access some characters on the *virtual keyboard*.
