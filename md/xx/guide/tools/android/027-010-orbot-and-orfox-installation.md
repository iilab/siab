*Figure 5: Important warning about how to use Orbot*

**Step 5:** A screen will appear asking you to grant **Orbot** *Superuser access*. *Superuser access* requires that your device is [rooted](/en/glossary#root) if you want to make use of **Orbot's** Transparent Proxy features - we will not explore this feature in the **Orbot** guide.

If your smartphone is not rooted, just **tick** the option that states *I understand and would like to continue without Superuser*. The next screen explains in order for you to benefit from Tor, you will need to use apps built to work with **Orbot**, or that support HTTP or SOCKS proxy.
