### 4.0 Before You Begin ###

In this section, you will learn how to recover a previously deleted file, as well as how to securely overwrite any private or sensitive information. 

**Recuva** lets you create a new folder for storing your recovered files. Although **Recuva** does let you use existing folders, for reasons of safety and security, we recommend that you copy your recovered files to a removable device like a backup drive or USB memory stick.  

**Important**: Although **Recuva** does an excellent job of securely overwriting information, it may leave a file marker indicating the existence of such a file. To protect your privacy and security, it makes sense to save any important, private or sensitive information to a removable device, and not to the original location or path.

### 4.1 How to Recover a Deleted File ###

To begin recovering a deleted file, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Connect** your removable disk or a USB memory stick to your computer.

**Step 2**. **Check** the check box next to a file you want to recover to enable the *Recover...* button or **double click** that file to both check *and* highlight that file.

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/recuva-en/25.png) to activate the *Browse For Folder* screen.

**Step 4**. **Select** a destination and then **click** ![](/sbox/screen/recuva-en/27.png) to create your recovery folder as shown in *Figure 1* below.

*Figure 1: The Browse For Folder dialog box displaying the newly created folder on a removable device*

**Note**: In this example, the folder for storing your recovered documents and files has been given an obvious label. However, keeping your digital privacy and security in mind, we encourage you to be more careful in labelling your own folder.  

**Step 5**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/recuva-en/30.png) to begin the file recovery process; a progress status screen appears as follows:

Now that you are comfortable with recovering a previously deleted file, you are ready to learn how to use the pop-up menu to perform multiple file recoveries and secure overwriting of files.

### 4.2 How to Use the Pop-up Menu ###
