## 6.1 Differences between the Installed and Portable versions of TrueCrypt ##

Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses.

As with many of the portable software tools documented here, **Portable TrueCrypt** allows you to use a powerful and simple file encryption tool without being detected. Having **Portable TrueCrypt** on removable device or USB memory stick lets you use it from different workstations.

There are very few differences between both the installed and portable versions of **Portable TrueCrypt**, the main one being that **Portable TrueCrypt** does not permit the encryption of the entire disk or system disk. 

See [more information regarding the differences between **TrueCrypt** and **Portable TrueCrypt**](http://andryou.com/truecrypt/docs/truecrypt-portable.php).

## 6.3 How to Eliminate All Traces of Having Extracted Portable TrueCrypt ##

**Important**: After you have successfully extracted **Portable TrueCrypt** to your external/removable device, you must **delete** the installation file from your computer to further eliminate any traces of you having downloaded and installed **Portable TrueCrypt**.

**Step 1**. **Navigate** to the folder in which **Portable TrueCrypt** was downloaded, and then **right click** the ![](/sbox/screen/truecryptportable-en/06.png) installation file to activate the **Windows** pop-up menu; then, **select** the **Delete** command to move it to your **Recycle Bin**.
