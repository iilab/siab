## 2.0 How to Extract the Tor Browser ##

The **Tor Browser** is a modified version of **Firefox** that will provide you with all you need to browse the Internet anonymously. This package requires no installation; it simply has to be extracted and run.

To extract the **Tor Browser**, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Double click** ![](/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/001.png); the *Open File - Security Warning* dialog box may appear. If it does, **click** ![](/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/002.png) to activate the program.
The language selection screen will appear next:

**Choose** the language from the pull-down menu and **click** OK button to activate window below.

**Step 2**: Choose the location to extract the **Tor Browser** 

**Note**: The **Tor Browser** does not automatically install itself in *C:\Program Files* directory path (unlike the majority of the installation procedures for our recommended tools) but instead creates a folder on your *Desktop*.

**Important**: You may also extract and use the **Tor Browser** to a different folder on your computer or to a USB memory stick. This may help you to conceal the fact that you are using **Tor** on your computer.

Either **click** ![](/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/004.png) to accept the default *Desktop* folder and activate window below. Or **click** ![](/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/005.png) to activate the *Browse for Folder* window and navigate to the desired folder path for extracting the **Tor Browser**.

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/004.png) to begin extracting the **Tor Browser**. Once completed you will be presented with a screen confirming the **Tor Browser** is installed and optionally to start it.

Note that the option *Run Tor Browser* is selected on the screen above. Once you **click** on *Finish* button **Tor Browser** will start automatically. 

In this example, after the extraction process has been completed, the **Tor Browser** will appear on your *Desktop* in a folder called *Tor Browser*.  To use the *Tor Browser* at any time just **double click** on ![](/sbox/screen/tor-en-1/010.png) in this folder.
