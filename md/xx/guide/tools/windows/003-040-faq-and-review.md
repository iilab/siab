## 5.0 FAQ and Review ##

Both Muhindo and Salima are pleasantly surprised at how easy **COMODO Firewall** is to use, and impressed by how it works silently in the background. However, they still have some questions. 

<div class="background" markdown="1"> 

***Q***: *If I donâ€™t use a firewall, what kinds of threats I would be exposed to? What are the different kinds of programs that can get onto my computer, and what harm could they do?*

***A***: *There are literally thousands of different programs that could enter your computer from the Internet, if it operates without a firewall. For instance, there are Web crawlers or 'spiders' designed to search for computers without a working firewall, and report their addresses to commercial, hostile or malicious parties. Additionally, there are programs which can 'hijack' your system, and use it to conduct fraudulent business transactions or send spam without your consent or knowledge - and you may end up being framed for illegal activities you didn't commit!*

***Q***: *If **COMODO Firewall** keeps out all these programs, why do I also need an anti-virus program and an anti-spyware program?*

***A***: *A firewall works to specifically restrict access to and from the Internet. It prevents a program or hacker from getting into your system, but cannot protect you from malware that you might download through email, Web pages or external disks. **COMODO Firewall** also includes **Defense+**, an anti-host intrusion prevention system which monitors the kinds of executable files you allow to run on your system. Anti-virus and anti-spyware programs complement and support a good firewall to prevent non-firewall related infections. And, of course, these tools can often remove existing malware already installed on your computer.* 

***Q***: *Are there any kinds of malware I need to watch out for which resemble* **Windows** *programs (or other friendly programs), but which are actually malware?* 

***A***: *Unfortunately, there are many such programs. You need to be extra careful about the origins of any software that you download or
install. Ideally, you should not install any software that is not absolutely relevant and necessary to your work, especially on computers that hold a lot of your sensitive data. Here is where the **COMODO Defense+** host-intrusion prevention system can prove very useful; by cross-comparing any new executable files from applications you have recently installed against a list of Trusted Software Vendors, as well as automatically submitting potentially malicious software for analysis, it can greatly enhance your Internet privacy and security.*

***Q***: *How good is **COMODO Firewall** at keeping out hackers?*

***A***: ***COMODO Firewall** does offer the potential for in-depth and refined control over access to your **Windows** platform. A firewall is only as powerful its configuration. Despite some initial challenges, you are strongly encouraged to persist in using it. Keep learning about **COMODO Firewall**; as your experience grows, you will reap the full benefits of its wide-ranging protection.*
