**What you will get in return**:

- The ability to **immunise** your computer system ***before*** it becomes infected with malicious problems and threats 


**GNU Linux, Mac OS and other Microsoft Windows Compatible Programs**:

To protect operating systems like **GNU Linux** and **Mac OS**, we recommend that you: **1)** regularly update your operating system, and all the programs installed upon it; **2)** use anti-virus program listed in [*Avast*](/en/avast_main) chapter; **3)** use firewall program listed in [*Comodo*](/en/comodofirewall_main) chapter; **4)** use a secure browser like [*Firefox*](/en/firefox_main) with the [*NoScript*](/en/firefox_noscript) add-on that prevents any scripts downloaded along with the web pages from starting up. These preventive measures are important to keep your **GNU Linux** or **Mac OS** computer protected.

The spyware and malware protection for computers running **Microsoft Windows** is a very important issue. There are thousands of new malware being created every day. Attack methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated. The preventive measures outlined in the previous paragraph are **mandatory** for all computers running **Microsoft Windows**. In addition, we strongly recommend the usage of **Spybot** as described in this chapter. 

However, if your computer gets infected despite these precautions, and you find yourself requiring additional tools, we recommend the following:

- Install [**SuperAntiSpyware**](http://superantispyware.com), update the spyware definitions, and then scan your computer;
- Install [**Malwarebytes Anti-Malware**](http://www.malwarebytes.org/), perform a *Quick Scan* and then a *Scan* when it finishes running, remove any detected malware displayed in *Show Results*;
- Use other free anti-spyware programs like:  **Microsoft [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-defender) [Defender](http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/windows-defender.aspx)**, [**Ad-Aware Internet Security**](http://www.lavasoft.com/) or [**SpywareBlaster**](http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/spywareblaster.html).

### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

**Spybot S&D** is a popular free program used to detect and remove different kinds of adware, malware and spyware from your computer system. It also lets you immunise your system against adware, malware and spyware, preventing them from infecting your computer once **Spybot** is installed. 

**Spybot S&D** is not an anti-virus tool. It can however run along side anti-virus software to enhance security of your PC.   

Adware is any software which displays advertising material on your computer. Certain kinds of adware function remarkably like spyware and can be invasive of your privacy and security. 

Malware (e.g. trojans and worms) is any kind of program designed to harm or hijack the operation of your computer without your consent or knowledge. 

Spyware is any kind of program that collects data, observes and records your private information and tracks your Internet habits. Like malware, it frequently runs on your computer secretly. As such, installing a program like **Spybot** will help you to protect your system and yourself. 

**Note**: **Windows Vista, 7 and 8** have a built-in anti-spyware program called **Windows Defender**. However, it seems to allow **Spybot** to work without any conflict.
