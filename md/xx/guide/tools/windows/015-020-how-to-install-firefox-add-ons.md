## 3.0 About Mozilla Add-ons ##

In the context of **Mozilla** products, an add-on is simply a lightweight software program which adds new features or extends existing functionality. As such, add-ons are sometimes referred to as *extensions*. For instance, the **uMatrix** add-on extends **Firefox** functionality to block scripts from defined servers. 

A **plugin** is essentially a piece of software usually designed by a third party to enable the use of their software within **Firefox** browser. An example of a common plugin would be the **Flash** plugin designed to display **Adobe Flash** content within the **Firefox** browser window.

## 3.1 How to Install Mozilla Add-ons ##

Downloading and installing **Mozilla Add-ons** is quick and simple. To begin downloading and installing different add-ons, perform the following steps: 

**Step 1**.  **Double-click** the **Firefox** desktop icon to open **Firefox**. 

**Step 2**. **Type** [**https://addons.mozilla.org/**](https://addons.mozilla.org/) into the **Firefox** address bar, and then **press** *Enter* to activate the **Mozilla Add-ons for Firefox** site.

**Step 3**. **Type** the name of the add-on into the **Mozilla** search field (the **uBlock Origin** add-on is used in this example) as follows:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/ublock_origin-win-en-01.png)

*Figure 1: The Mozilla Firefox Add-ons Search bar displaying Adblock Plus* 

**Step 4**. Either **click** ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/21.png) or **press** *Enter* to display the following screen:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/ublock_origin-win-en-02.png)

*Figure 2: The Search Results for uBlock Origin pane*

**Tip**: The green *Add to Firefox* button only appears when the cursor is placed within a specified add-on section. 

**Step 5**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/23.png) to activate the following screens:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/ublock_origin-win-en-03.png)

*Figure 3: uBlock Origin :: Search :: Add-ons for Firefox - Mozilla Firefox window*

**Step 6**. **Click** {Instal} to activate the following windows:

*Figure 4: The uBlock Origin :: Search :: Add-ons for Firefox - Mozilla Firefox with a pop-up notification*

**Tip**: Many add-ons and extensions currently require that **Firefox** be restarted to successfully install them. **Click** {Restart now} and your Add-on will be active. If it doesn't need a restart it will be active directly like in the case of uBlock Origin

**Step 7**. **Select** *Add-ons* item in the *Tools* menu in the **Firefox** menu bar, to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/ublock_origin-win-en-05.png)

**Important**: **Do not install add-ons from unknown sources.** Instead, always install add-ons from the [**https://addons.mozilla.org/**](https://addons.mozilla.org/) web site for improved security.

## 3.2 How to Disable or Remove a Mozilla Add-on ##

The *Add-ons* tab displays all installed add-ons as shown in *Figure 8*. Any **Mozilla** add-on can be either temporarily disabled by **clicking** {Disable} or completely removed by **clicking** {Remove}. However, in some instances **Firefox** *must* be restarted for the changes to take effect.

## 3.3 How to Update Mozilla Add-ons ## 

Every so often, the various add-ons designed for use must be updated to be compatible or current with the latest version of **Firefox**. Depending on your connection speed, you may choose to either update these add-ons automatically or manually. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/36.png) to activate its associated menu, and then **select** *Check for updates* item to manually update your add-ons as shown in *Figure 7* below.

## 3.4 How to Update Mozilla Plugins ##

Given that a few plugins may not automatically update themselves, users are strongly recommended to check for the latest updates of **Mozilla Plugins**. 

To manually check for updates of plugins, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** [**https://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck**](https://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck) to activate the following site:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/plugin-win-en-03.png)

*Figure 10: The Mozilla Firefox Plugin Check & Updates site*

**Step 2**. **Address** each plugin issue presented on the web page, indicated by the status on the button as follows:

- For plugins displaying ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/39.png) we **strongly** recommend that you *immediately* update them by clicking this button, and follow its instruction page. (Alternatively, please follow the steps after this list of buttons to disable or remove obsolete plugins.) 

- For plugins displaying ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/45.png), consider disabling or removing them unless the plugins are required and updated individually.

- For plugins displaying ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/plugin-win-en-08.png), review them individually to determine which are required, and disable or remove those which are unknown or unnecessary.

Repeat these steps until all the issues on the *Plugin Check & Updates* page are resolved. It is *absolutely essential* that you search for updates on a **monthly basis** at minimum. Plugins are constantly being improved and upgraded to deal with all manner of evolving security problems. 

To **disable** an unknown plugin or one that is no longer required, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. Select the menu ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/plugin-win-en-02.png) >Add-ons to activate the *Add-ons Manager tab*

**Step 2**. Click ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/plugin-win-en-01.png) to reveal a complete list of **Mozilla Firefox plugins**, identify the plugin you would like to disable and then click the scroll down bar choosing {Never Activate}.

However if you want to remove the plugin from your computer you will have to do few steps more.
With Windows 10 there are two options that you could use:

**Option 1**. 

**Step 1.** Go to the **Search the Web and Windows** bar in the left down corner of your screen, enter **Control Panel** and click on the search result for *Control Panel*

**Step 2. Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/plugin-win-en-04.png)

**Step 3. Select** the relevant program from the window, and then **click** {Uninstall} like it is shown below in *Figure 11*

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/plugin-win-en-07.png)

*Figure 11: Control Panel, showing uninstall selected for Flash plugin*

**Option 2**.

**Step 1. Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/plugin-win-en-05.png) menu > Settings, that will get you to the *Settings* Window

**Step 2. Click** on the option **System** Display, notifications, apps, power

**Step 3. Choose Apps & Features** from the menu bar, then on the right side **choose** the program you want to remove, **click** on it and it will give you the option to **uninstall** it, like shown bellow in *Figure 12*

**IMPORTANT**: **Adobe Flash** and **Oracle Java** are known to contain many security vulnerabilities that may let remote users assume control of your computer, and install spyware to access or monitor all your communication and data. It is **strongly** advised that you uninstall both of those programs from your computer(s), or at least disable their associated plugins in **Firefox**. For more information about how to disable or remove Java, please refer to [steps to disable Java for all browsers on your computer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml) or [guide on how to uninstall Java from your computer](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_java.xml).
