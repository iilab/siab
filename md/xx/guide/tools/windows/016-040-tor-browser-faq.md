## 5.0 FAQ ##

**Tor** is a beautifully maintained and rigorously tested piece of software. The **Tor** network is used by hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, and continual improvements have made it increasingly secure and stable. Although the explanations in this chapter may seem complex, in many cases you will not have to read past [**Section 3.1.1 How to Connect to the Tor Network - Direct Access**](/en/tor_anonymitynetwork) in order to get the **Tor Browser** working properly.

***Q**: Why should I use the **Tor Browser**?*

***A**: Good question. The **Tor Browser** is a great tool if you need to circumvent Internet censorship in order to access certain websites. It's also useful if you don't want your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to know what websites you're visiting, or if you don't want those websites to know your location or point of origin.*

***Q**: *When I run the **Tor Browser**, do all of my other programs communicate anonymously through **Tor network**?*

***A**: *No, it is very important to remember that you must access the **Tor network** only from the **Tor Browser**. All your other programs communicate directly with the servers in the Internet. To be completely certain that you are communicating over **Tor network**, you can always manually check it at the **https://check.torproject.org** site. **Tor** also relies on your exercise of caution, common sense and good judgement when browsing new or unfamiliar websites.*

***Q**: *Is **Tor** protecting all and any communication when using the **Tor Browser**?*

***A**: **Tor** will encrypt all communications between you and *within* the **Tor** network. However, bear in mind that **Tor** cannot encrypt your traffic between the **Tor** network and destination website you communicate with. For this **you must use the HTTPS protocol** or other similar encryption forms â€“ especially if you value the privacy and security of your information!*
