**GNU Linux, Mac OS and other Microsoft Windows Compatible Programs:**

The **Mozilla Firefox** browser is available for **GNU Linux**, **Mac OS**, **Microsoft Windows** and other operating systems. The secure management of web pages is absolutely *vital*, as they are most common source of malware infection. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you use **Mozilla Firefox** and the prescribed add-ons for this purpose. The security advantages available in **Firefox**, a cross-platform free and open source program, are even more important when compared to its commercial equivalents like **Internet Explorer**. However, if you would prefer to use a program other than **Mozilla Firefox**, we recommend the following alternatives available for **GNU Linux**, **Mac OS** and **Microsoft Windows**:

- [**Google Chrome**](http://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [**Opera**](http://www.opera.com/)

## 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ##

This chapter assumes that you already know how to use a web browser; it will not explain how to use the **Mozilla Firefox** browser functions. Its purpose is to explain some additional functions that will make using it more secure. 

- **Mozilla Firefox Add-ons** (also referred to as 'extensions'), are small programs which add new features or extend existing functionality of **Firefox**.

- **Mozilla Firefox Plugins** are small pieces of software, usually designed by a third party, to enable the use of their software within **Firefox** browser. 

In this chapter, you will learn how to download, install and use the following **Mozilla Add-ons** to increase the privacy, safety and security of your **Firefox** web browser, and of your Internet experience as a whole. 

The **uMatrix** add-on is documented separately in section [**4.0 About uMatrix**](/en/firefox_noscript). Other add-on are documented in [**More Useful Firefox Add-Ons**](/en/firefox_others)

**Important**: The overwhelming majority of malware and spyware infections originate from web pages. It is very important that you always consider whether it is safe to open given web address, especially if you received it by email. Before you decide to open a page, we recommend that you scan the web address using the following page scanners:

- [**www.onlinelinkscan.com**](http://onlinelinkscan.com/)
- [**www.phishtank.com**](http://www.phishtank.com/index.php)
