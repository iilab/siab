## 4.0 About NoScript ##

![](/sites/securitybkp.ngoinabox.org/files/u9/noscript.png)

**NoScript** is a particularly useful **Mozilla Add-on** that can help protect your computer from malicious websites on the Internet. It operates by implementing a 'white list' of sites that you have determined as acceptable, safe or trusted (like a home-banking site or an on-line journal). All other sites are considered potentially harmful and their functioning is restricted, until you have determined that the content of a particular site presents no harm; at this point, you may add it to the white list. 

**NoScript** will automatically start blocking all banners, pop-up advertisements, **JavaScript** and **Java** code, as well as other potentially harmful web site attributes. **NoScript** cannot differentiate between harmful content and content necessary to correctly display a web site. It is up to you to make exceptions for those sites with content that you think is safe.

## 4.1 How to Use NoScript ##

Before you begin using **NoScript** ensure that it was successfully installed by **selecting Tools > Add-ons** to activate the *Add-ons* window and confirm that it has been installed.

**Tip**: Although **NoScript** might seem a little frustrating at first (as the websites you have always visited may not display properly), you will immediately profit from the automated object-blocking feature. This will restrict pesky advertisements, pop-up messages and malicious code built (or hacked) into web pages.  

**NoScript** will run silently in the background until it detects the presence of **JavaScript**, **Adobe Flash** or other script-like content. At that point **NoScript** will block this content and status bar will appear on the bottom of the **Firefox** window as follows:

The **NoScript** status bar displays information about which *objects* (for example, advertisements and pop-up messages) and *scripts* are currently prevented from executing themselves on your system. The following two figures are prime examples of **NoScript** at work: In *Figure 2*, **NoScript** has successfully blocked an advertisement created in **Adobe Flash Player** on a commercial website.

In *Figure 3*, the **Twitter** web site notifies you that **JavaScript** must be enabled (at least temporarily) to view this web site.

Since **NoScript** does not differentiate between malicious and real code, certain key features and functions (for instance, a tool bar) may be missing. Some web pages present content, including script-like content, from more than one website. For example, a website like **www.twitter.com** has two sources of scripts (*twitter.com* and *twimg.com*):

To unblock scripts in these circumstances, start by **selecting** the *Temporarily Allow [website name]* option (in this instance, *Temporarily allow twitter.com*). However, if this does not allow you to view the page you may determine, through a process of trial and error, the minimum number of websites required to view your chosen content. For instance, on **Twitter**, you must **select** the *Temporarily allow twitter.com* and *Temporarily allow twimg.com* options, in order for **Twitter** to work.

**Warning**! Under **no** circumstances should you ever select the *Allow Scripts Globally (dangerous)* option. As far as possible, avoid selecting the *Allow all from this page* option. Occasionally, you may have to permit all scripts; in this situation, ensure that you only do this temporarily for sites you really trust, that is, until the end of your on-line session. It only takes a *single* injection of malicious code to compromise your on-line privacy and safety. 

For websites that you trust and frequently visit, **select** the *Allow [website name]* option. (In the example above, *Allow twitter.com* and *Allow twimg.com* have been selected). Selecting this option permits **NoScript** to permanently list that website as trusted.
