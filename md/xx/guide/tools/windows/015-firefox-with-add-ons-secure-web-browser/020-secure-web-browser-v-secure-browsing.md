title: Secure web browser v secure browsing

---

When we talk about **security** and **privacy** we can’t think only about the technical solutions of browsers, meaning which one is the safest and use only one of them. Cause browsers also have their own identifiers that by using just one of them for everything, we make it very easy for companies to cross the information about our search and use, then identify easily what we do, which by it self is very concerning. For more information on the unique identifiers of your browser see [panopticlick](https://panopticlick.eff.org). Although we do not recommend using Facebook and Google as the biggest collectors of our data, we acknowledge the necessity for their use in certain conditions.

**Note** Using Firefox browser for your Facebook profile and your Google profile is leaving space for both Facebook and Google to cross reference the searches and activities that you have done by that one browser which is basically very insecure. That is why when you enter a website and for example you read an article and there is the *Facebook like option* for the article, when you click on it Facebook already knows it is you because you have logged in from that browser before. That is also why we talked about clearing your history, cache, cookies etc. and use even less unique features for your browser, as special and unique and beautiful they could be, they also make you more vulnerable in identifying your browser.

**Tip** What we recommend, as we know that some of the services that are offered by companies are essential and it is very hard to stop using them, is for you to think about what browser you use for what. For example if you access your Facebook with Firefox, then don’t access it with Chrome and use Chrome only for the Google related services that you use. And if you need to do a research for more sensitive data that you don’t want to be connected to you, you should consider using Tor browser. You can read more in our section about [Tor](/torbrowswer)

**Be careful** If you use Tor and access Facebook with your real name, then there is no point in using Tor. 

Security and privacy are not just about technicalities, it is also about behaviour and how we manage our profiles and browsers.

Having in mind all of this we also recommend you to use the portable version of Firefox and think of a separate profile that you would use only with your portable browser. This could make it easier for you to control what data and identifiers are connected or crossed to you.
