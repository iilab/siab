## 2.0 Overview of the COMODO Firewall Installation ##

Installing **COMODO Firewall** is divided into two stages: the first involves manually disabling the **Windows Firewall**, and the second is the actual **COMODO Firewall** software installation. 

Ideally, you should only use one firewall program for your computer system at any given time. If you are currently using another firewall on your computer, it must be uninstalled before you install **COMODO Firewall**, so as to eliminate potential software conflicts between similar types of programs.

**Important**: Although no **Domain Name System** (**DNS**) server is ever completely secure, the advantages of using the **COMODO Secure DNS Servers** outweigh the disadvantages. It offers additional protection from *pharming* and *phishing*, which are two popular methods used by malicious forces to 'hijack' or redirect your computer to a dangerous or hostile site. **COMODO Secure DNS Servers** may also protect you from government interference, while being easy to set up during the installation process, and by facilitating safer access to web sites which are registered with **COMODO**.
