**GNU Linux, Mac OS and other Microsoft Windows Compatible Programs:**

**GNU/Linux** comes with a built-in firewall ([**netfilter/iptables**](http://www.netfilter.org/)) and very good network security setup. There are various user-friendly interfaces to the built-in firewall, we particularly recommend [**GUFW**](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Gufw) (**Graphical Uncomplicated Firewall**) (see [**more information**](http://blog.bodhizazen.net/linux/firewall-ubuntu-gufw/)).

**Mac OS** has a reliable and strong internal firewall, that can be complemented by various additional interface add-ons which improve its existing capabilities, among them: [**NoobProof**](http://www.hanynet.com/noobproof/) or [**IPSecuritas**](http://www.lobotomo.com/products/IPSecuritas/). For users with a budget, we recommend [**Little Snitch**](http://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html), to extend your Internet privacy and security and personal information protection to the next level.

Apart from **COMODO Firewall**, there are many excellent alternatives for **Microsoft Windows**. Users may find either [**ZoneAlarm Free Firewall**](http://www.zonealarm.com/security/en-us/zonealarm-pc-security-free-firewall.htm) or [**Outpost Firewall Free**](http://free.agnitum.com/) equally effective substitutes.

### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

A firewall acts like a doorman or guard for your computer. It has a set
of rules about what information should be let in and what information
should be let out of your computer. A firewall is the first program
that receives and analyses incoming information from the Internet and
the last program that scans outgoing information to the Internet. 

It prevents hackers or other intruders from accessing personal
information stored on your computer, and prevents malware programs from
sending information to the Internet without your authorisation. **COMODO Firewall** is a well-known and respected firewall software. It is free software, which means you can use it without purchasing a license. 

Running a custom firewall program may initially require considerable time and effort to ensure that all the settings are correct and suited to the way you use your computer. After an initial learning period, the firewall will work seamlessly, requiring minimal intervention on your part. 

**Warning**!: Never access the Internet without a firewall
installed and running on your computer! Even if your Internet modem or
router has its own firewall, it is strongly recommended that you have 
one installed on your computer as well.
