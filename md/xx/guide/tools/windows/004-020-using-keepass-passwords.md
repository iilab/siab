## 3.0 Using KeePass Passwords ##

Given that a secure password is not easily memorised, **KeePass**
lets you copy it from the database and paste it onto whatever account
or website requires it. For greater security, a copied password will
only remain on the clipboard for about 10 seconds, so it will save time
to have your account or website already open and running, so that you
can paste the relevant password there as required. 

**Step 1**. **Right click** on the required password entry to activate a drop-down list, 

**Step 2**. **Select Copy Password** as follows:

**Step 3**. Go to the related account or site and **paste** the password into the appropriate field:

**Tip**: For efficient copying, pasting and switching windows, use the keyboard shortcuts. **Press and hold** the *Ctrl* key, then press *C* to copy a password. **Press and hold** the *Ctrl* key, then press *V* to paste that password. **Press and hold** the *Alt* key, then **press** the *tab* key to switch between open programs and windows.

**Note**: By using **KeePass** all the time, you never actually have to see or know what your password is. The copy/paste functions take care of moving it from the database to the required window. If you use the *Random Generator* feature and then transfer this password to a new email account registration process, you will be using a password that you have never seen in plain view. And it still works!
