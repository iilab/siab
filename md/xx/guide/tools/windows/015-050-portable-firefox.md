## 1.0 Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Firefox ##

Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses. 

There are no other differences between **Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition** and the version designed to be installed on a local computer.
