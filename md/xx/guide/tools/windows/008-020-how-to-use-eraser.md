## 3.0 How to use Eraser in Windows Explorer ##

It is common for people to use **Eraser** through the **My Computer Windows Explorer** programs, rather than through the **Eraser** program itself. 

**Step 1**. **Open** a folder containing a file you want to delete permanently.

**Step 2**. **Right-click** on this file. Two new options appear on the pop-up menu, *Erase* and *Eraser Secure Move* as follows:

![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/14.png)

*Figure 1: Erase and Eraser Secure Move options*

We are going to use the *Erase* option to permanently delete this file.

**Step 3**. **Select** the **Erase** item from the menu, as shown in *Figure 1* above.

*The Confirm Erasing pop up dialog box will appear as follows*:

![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/15.png)

*Figure 2: The Confirm Erasing pop up dialog box*

If the file displayed in the pop up dialog box is the one you want to delete permanently, perform the following step:

**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/16.png) to *permanently* erase or wipe the file from your computer.

**Warning**: Any file deleted in this manner with be *irretrievably* and permanently deleted. Therefore, you must be completely sure that you really want to erase a particular file, or group of files. 

To securely move a file/s from one location to another (for example, from your computer to a USB memory stick):

**Step 5**. **Select** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/17.png)

You will need to answer the same warning prompt, as above, to continue.

## 3.1 How to Wipe Unused Disk Space ##

Erasing unused disk space involves wiping all traces of previously existing files from the 'empty
space' of your hard drive/portable storage device. This empty space usually contains files that were not deleted properly (please refer to the [**Recuva**](/en/recuva_main) **Hands-on** guide and the **How-to Booklet** [**Chapter 6**](/chapter-6) from more information about this).

**Step 1**. **Select Start > Programs > Eraser > Eraser**

**Tip**: You can perform the wiping task on demand or you can schedule it to occur at a specified time. 

**Important**: This process could take between 2 and 5 hours to complete and will slow your computer down while it operates. It maybe a good idea to run or schedule the free space wipe when you are not using your computer (or have gone home/to bed for the night).

## 3.2 How to use the On-Demand Task ##

To create an *On-Demand* task for wiping *unused disk space*, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/18.png)

**Step 2**. **Select File > New Task** as follows: 

![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/19.png)

*Figure 3: Selecting a New Task in the File menu*

The *Unused space on drive* option should be selected. 

**Step 3**. **Choose** the drive you want to clear the free space on. (In this example, the *Local Disk (C:)* has been selected. This is usually the primary hard drive on most computers.)

**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/21.png) to create, and then run the task which will appear in the **Eraser** user interface.

**Step 5**. **Right-click** the task to activate the pop-up menu as follows:

*Figure 6: The Eraser pop up dialog box*

**Step 7**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/16.png).

## 3.3 How to Use the Scheduler Feature ##

Since we may not always remember to do this kind of computer 'housekeeping', **Eraser** has an option that lets you schedule a wiping task so that it runs at an appointed time every day, or one day per week.

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/25.png) in the **Eraser** main screen.

**Step 2**. **Select File > New Task** as follows:

![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/26.png)

*Figure 8: Selecting a New Task in the File menu*

This will activate a window similar screen to *Figure 4* (in which you created an on-demand task). 

**Step 3**. **Set** these options as outlined in section [**3.2 How to Use the on-Demand Tasks Option**](/en/using_eraser#3.2).

*Figure 9: The Eraser Task Properties screen displaying the Schedule tab*

**Step 4**. **Click** the *Schedule* tab to activate its associated pane with two configurable settings:

*Figure 10: The Eraser Schedule tab*

**Step 5**. **Select** day or event item that best suits your needs from the *Every* drop-down list.

**Step 6**. **Enter** the time that best suits your needs in the *At* timer, which can only be entered in a 24-hour format.

**Step 7**. After you have set a time and day, **click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/21.png).

*The scheduled task will appear as follows*:

**Note**: The computer must be switched on for the scheduled task to run.

## 3.4 How to Remove a Task ##

After you have run either an on-demand task or a scheduled task, you may want to remove it from your task list. 

To remove an on-demand task, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/18.png) to display its corresponding task list as follows:

![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/30.png)

*Figure 12: The Eraser task list*

**Step 2**. **Select** the task you want to remove, as shown in *Figure 12* above. 

**Step 3**. **Right-click** to activate the pop-up menu and **select** the *Delete* item to remove the task from the task list. (Alternatively, you may **click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/31.png) located beneath the **Eraser** menu bar.

The process for removing a *Scheduled Task* is almost identical. To remove a scheduled task, perform the following step:

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/eraser-en/25.png), and then **repeat** **steps** 2 and 3, as described in this section.
