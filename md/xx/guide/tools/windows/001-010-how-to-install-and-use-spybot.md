**Reminder**: Before you begin checking for potential threats, please run the **Spybot** *Updater*. 

To check for potential threats, follow these steps: 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/spybot-en-1/14.png) to launch the **Spybot** *Start Center*

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/spybot-en-1/37.png) to activate the screen below:

![](/sbox/screen/spybot-en-1/38.png)

*Figure 18: System Scan (Spybot - Search & Destroy)*


**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/spybot-en-1/40.png) to begin scanning your system. *Note - If you have a lot of data, files, programmes etc. this could take 20 minutes to an hour*

*Figure 19: System Scan (Spybot - Search & Destroy)*

After the scan has been completed, the number and kinds of potential malware found will be listed as shown below:

![](/sbox/screen/spybot-en-1/41.png)

*Figure 20: Scan for malware displaying potential malware* 

**Step 4**. **Select** the file and review the *Details* box on the left of the screen for each potential threat found to determine if the malware is a genuine threat. 

**Remember** - a *false positive* means that a harmless file, folder, program or registry key could be categorised as malware. Deleting such could cause an issue an issue to another program.


![](/sbox/screen/spybot-en-1/42.png)

*Figure 21: Scan for malware - Details* 

**Tip**: The *Threat Level* is displayed by a colour indicator bar. An *Estimated Danger* rating of *Marginal* or *Very Low* will display as green. As the *Threat Level* moves from *Medium* to *High*, the colour indicator will change from orange to red. At a glance, it will be easy to gauge the potential threat. For example, most Browsers used *Tracking Cookies* when you visit a website. If the information they store is not excessive, the *Estimated Danger* rating my be *Marginal* or *Very Low*. You may choose to keep the cookies for certain websites for convenience.
