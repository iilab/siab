## 4.0 Before You Begin ##

**CCleaner** also lets you clean the **Windows Registry**, a database which stores configuration information, hardware and software settings on your system. Every time you alter system configuration information, install software or perform other routine tasks, these changes are reflected and stored in the **Windows Registry**. 

Over time, however, the **Windows Registry** accumulates outdated configuration information and settings, including traces of obsolete programs. The **CCleaner** *Registry* option lets you scan and remove such information, improving the overall function and speed of your system, as well as protecting your digital privacy and security.  

**Tip**: A scan of the **Windows Registry** should be performed on a weekly or monthly basis.

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/34.png) to activate the following confirmation dialog box as follows:
