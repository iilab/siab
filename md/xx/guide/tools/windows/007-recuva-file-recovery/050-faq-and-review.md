## 5.0 FAQ and Review ##

Elena and Nikolai are thrilled with **Recuva**, particularly how easily and efficiently it works. However, they are now curious about its advanced options, and have some questions about the software.

<div class="background" markdown="1">

***Q**: Are there file types which are impossible for **Recuva** to recover?*

***A**: No, **Recuva** can recover all file types.*

***Q**: Can I recover a file that has been securely deleted?*

***A**: Once it's been securely deleted, it's gone forever.*

***Q**: I've noticed that sometimes, even after I've securely deleted a file, it's still marked as recoverable. How is this possible?*

***A**: It's possible that you are seeing a file marker, an indicator of where the original file was located. However, if you recover and open that file, you will find its contents unreadable.*

***Q**: I deleted a file accidentally; having created it less than five minutes ago, I thought it would be easily recoverable. How come **Recuva** was unable to recover it?*

***A**: Ironically, a document or file existing for only few minutes has  greater likelihood of being overwritten by temporary files than one which has existed for a longer period. **Recuva** doesn't easily recover files which have been deleted almost immediately after creation.*  

***Q**: After I've cleaned my computer system using **CCleaner**, can that data be recovered later?*

***A**: Depending on the skill and resources available to someone attempting such a recovery, it's possible. It also depends on the secure deletion settings you used for cleaning your temporary files and the **Windows Registry** in **CCleaner**. To minimize their ability to recover your private and sensitive information, enable the Secure Deletion option in **CCleaner**, and wipe any empty space on hard drives and in the **Windows Master File Table**. In **Recuva**, you can increase the number of passes for securely overwriting data as well. This is a great question because it also shows you how different tools complement each other, in your efforts to protect your digital privacy and security.*
