## 2.3 An Overview of Account Registration and Setup Process in Pidgin ##

There are four basic steps in the **Pidgin** account registration and setup process; registering an existing **IM** account to **Pidgin**, adding a correspondent or *buddy*, getting your buddy to do the same, and lastly accessing the chat window for your first chat session.

Given that chat or **IM** sessions take place between two parties, the examples on this page describe how the various forms and windows appear to *both* buddies/correspondents (represented by two fictional characters, Salima and Terence) at different stages of the account registration and set up process. All examples are based on the **Riseup.net** IM service.

**Note**: Before you can start using **Pidgin**, you must already have an **Instant Messaging** (**IM**) account with one of the providers listed in *Figure 6* below. If you would like to create an **IM** account, we recommend using **Riseup** email account which can be later used for [XMPP communication](https://help.riseup.net/en/chat). Please refer to chapter [**RiseUp - Secure Email Service**](/en/riseup_main) for information and instructions on how to setup **Riseup** account. You can also use XMPP account providers listed in section [2.2 How to Add Accounts in Jitsi](/en/jitsi_account#2.2), like: [Jit.si](https://jitsi.org/Register/Register) or Google Account.

## 2.4 How to Register Your Instant Messaging Account to Pidgin ##

To register your **IM** account to **Pidgin**, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/13.png) or **select Start > All Programs > Pidgin** to launch **Pidgin**. The first time you use **Pidgin**, the following screen will appear:

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/14.png)

*Figure 4: The Accounts confirmation window*

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/15.png) to display a blank *Add Account* window as follows: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/16.png) 

*Figure 5: The Add Account screen displaying Basic, Advanced and Proxy tabs*

**Step 3**. **Click** the *Protocol* drop-down list to view the **IM** service protocols supported by **Pidgin** as follows: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/17.png) 

*Figure 6: The Add Account window displaying a list of supported IM protocols*

**Step 4**. **Select** the appropriate **IM** protocol.

**Note**: Different **IM** service providers will display their specific text fields for you to fill in. Some of them are automatically partly filled in. However, all services require that you to enter a username and a password.

**Step 5**. **Type** in your email address (for example, [**terencethetester@riseup.net**](mailto:terencethetester@riseup.net)) in the *Username* field. 

**Step 6**. **Type** in your password for this specific account in the *Password* field. 

**Step 7**. **Type** a nickname you would like to be identified by in the *Local Alias* field. (This field is optional.) 

**Important**: To optimise your privacy and security, do *not* enable the *Remember password* option. It means that **Pidgin** will prompt you for your password whenever you log in to chat on-line. Doing this prevents imposters from logging in and pretending to be you, if you happen leave your computer unattended for some time. Also, remember to **select** the *Quit* item from the *Buddies* drop-down menu after finishing your chat session! 

A completed *Add Account* screen would resemble the following:

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/18.png) 

*Figure 7: An example of a completed Add Account form*
 
**Step 8**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/19.png) to complete adding your account, and simultaneously display an updated *Accounts* the *Buddy List* screens as follows:

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/20.png)      ![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/21.png)

*Figure 8: An updated Accounts window;*   *Figure 9: The Buddy List in Active mode*

After completing these steps, you are now ready to register your **Pidgin** buddies, by entering their contact information.

## 2.5 How to Add a Buddy in Pidgin ##
Adding buddies or correspondents in **Pidgin** involves adding and saving their contact information. In the example that follows, Terence will add Salima as his buddy.

To add a buddy to your **IM** account in **Pidgin**, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** *Buddies* to display its corresponding menu, and then **select** the *+ Add Buddy...* item as follows: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/22.png)

*Figure 10: The Buddy List menu with the "Add Buddy..." item selected*

This will display the following screen: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/23.png)

*Figure 11: The Add Buddy window*

**Step 2**. If you have multiple accounts, **select** the account that corresponds to the same messaging service as your 'buddy'.  

**Note**: Both your buddy and yourself *must* be using the *same* messaging service, even if he/she is not using **Pidgin**. You cannot add an **ICQ** or **MSN** buddy to a **Google Talk** account. However, you can register and use multiple accounts based on these supported protocols in **Pidgin**. Whereby you may chat with one buddy using your **XMPP** account and with another using your **ICQ** or **MSN** accounts. 

**Step 3**. **Type** in your buddy's email address in the *Username* field.  

The following step is optional.

**Step 4**. **Type** in an *Alias* or nickname for your buddy in the *(Optional) Alias* field, so that your *Add Buddy* form resembles the following screen: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/24.png)

*Figure 12: An example of a completed Add Buddy form*

**Step 5**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/19.png) to add your buddy.

**Note**: This will send a message to your buddy requesting approval or authorisation of your request, and will appear for your correspondent *Buddy List* as follows:  

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/25.png)

*Figure 13: The Authorize buddy request as it appears on Salima's Buddy List*

At this point, your buddy must perform the following step:

**Step 6**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/26.png) to add this person as your buddy and display her/him in your *Buddy List* as follows:

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/27.png)

*Figure 14: Terence's Buddy List displaying Salima as his buddy*

**Note**: In the example above, Salima's *Alias* or nickname is displayed, adding yet another level of identity protection. 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/30.png)

*Figure 15: Terence's Buddy List window displaying Salima's as his newly created buddy*

After you have added, authorised and confirmed your **Pidgin** chat buddy, he/she must now do the same with your **IM** contact information by repeating **steps 1 through 6** from their own account.

## 2.6 How to Open an IM window in Pidgin #

To open an **IM** chat window in **Pidgin**, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Right click** your buddy's name in the *Buddy List* to display a pop-up menu listing all the tasks you can perform as follows: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/31.png) 

*Figure 16: The Buddy tasks menu*

**Step 2**. **Select** the *IM* item from the pop-up menu to activate a typical chat window as follows: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/32.png) 

*Figure 17: A typical chat window in Pidgin*

Now you are almost ready to chat with your buddy using **Pidgin**. First, however, you must configure the **OTR** encryption to ensure that your chat sessions will be private and secure. Seen next page for this.

## 2.7 How to Re-enable an Account in Pidgin ##

From time to time, you might find that your IM account has disabled itself in **Pidgin**; perhaps because **Pidgin** program was improperly closed due to Internet connection being interrupted, or your computer frozen. Fortunately, **Pidgin** offers a way to re-enable your account. To do this, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/13.png) or **select Start > Pidgin** to launch **Pidgin**.

**Step 2**. **Open** the *Accounts* menu, and then **select** the *Manage Accounts* item as follows: 

![](/sbox/screen/pidgin-en-1/33.png)

*Figure 18: The Accounts menu with the *Manage Accounts item selected (re-sized)*

*This will open the following screen:*
