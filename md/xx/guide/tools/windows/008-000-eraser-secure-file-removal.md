**Homepage**  
[**www.heidi.ie/eraser**](http://www.heidi.ie/eraser/) 

**Computer Requirements**

- All Windows Versions 

**Version used in this guide**

- 5.86a <br>
***Note**: Although you may find newer versions of **Eraser** on the developers' website, they are not included here, as they require the installation of the **.Net Framework** on your **Microsoft Windows**. Downloading the **.Net Framework** may take a very long for users with low bandwith*

**License**

- Free and Open-Source Software

**Required Reading**

- How-to Booklet chapter [**6. How to destroy sensitive information**](/chapter-6)

**Level**: 1: Beginner, **2: Average**, 3: Intermediate, 4: Experienced, 5: Advanced


**Time required to start using this tool**: 20 minutes

**What you will get in return**:

- The ability to permanently delete unwanted files from your computer
- The ability to delete all recoverable files that are currently invisible on your computer


**GNU Linux, Mac OS and other Microsoft Windows Compatible Programs**:

On the **GNU/Linux**, the secure-delete package can be [**used from the terminal**](http://www.ghacks.net/2010/08/26/securely-delete-files-with-secure-delete/) to both securely delete files and folders, or wipe free space on the disk. Secure-delete can also be [**integrated with a graphical file manager**](http://techthrob.com/2010/07/07/adding-a-secure-delete-option-to-nautilus-file-manager-in-linux/).

On the **Mac OS** you can use the **Finder** menu *Secure Empty Trash...* item to permanently get rid of files and folders. You may also use the **Mac OS** generic program *Disk Utility* to securely erase entire disk or a free space on internal or external disks.

On **Microsoft Windows** apart from **Eraser** described in this chapter one can also use [**CCleaner**](/en/ccleaner_main) to securely delete files and folders from **Recycle Bin**. **CCleaner** can also wipe free space on the disk. Another recommended tool that can be used to securely delete files is [**Freeraser**](http://www.freeraser.com/).

We would also like to recommend the following multiplatform tool: [**DBAN - Darik's Boot And Nuke**](http://www.dban.org/). It is a package which you burn onto a CD and start your computer from. **DBAN** allows you securely delete the whole content of any hard disk that it detects, which makes it the *ideal* utility for bulk or emergency data destruction.

## 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ##

**Eraser** is used to permanently delete or *wipe* sensitive data from your computer. It does this by writing over the data you want to delete. You can select files or folders to be wiped in this way. **Eraser** will also delete copies of files that may exist in your computer without your knowledge. This includes files you have previously deleted using the standard **Windows** deletion method, and copies of documents you have worked on in the past. 

- Deleting files with **Eraser** can be performed on demand or scheduled to run at a specified times.
- If you schedule **Eraser** to run at a certain time, then your computer must be switched on at the specified time or the wipe will not happen. 
- Once you have deleted a file using **Eraser**, it cannot be recovered using a file recovery program.
- For greater security, you should set **Eraser** to overwrite files selected for deletion between 3 and 7 times.
- **Eraser** can be used to wipe the free space off your computer. This refers to permanently wiping all past traces of work that may not have been properly deleted and could, in theory, be recoverable.
