## 4.1 Differences between Installed and Portable Versions of KeePass ##

Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses.

There are no other differences between **Portable KeePass** and the version designed to be installed.
