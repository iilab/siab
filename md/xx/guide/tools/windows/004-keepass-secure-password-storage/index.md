### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

**KeePass** is an easy-to-use, powerful tool that helps
you store and manage all your passwords in a highly secure database.
You can put both that database and the **KeePass** program on a USB memory
stick and carry it with you. The database is protected by a 'master
password' that you create. This password is also used to encrypt the
entire contents of the database. You can store your existing passwords
in **KeePass** or have it generate one for you. **KeePass** doesn't require any prior configuration or specific installation instructions. It's ready to go when you are!
