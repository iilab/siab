### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

In situations where private or sensitive files may have been mistakenly deleted, **Recuva** can help you to scan for and restore some of them. As discussed in chapter [**6. How-to Destroy Sensitive Information**](/en/chapter-6), a file deleted using the standard **Windows** operating system *Delete* function, even after the *Recycle Bin* has been emptied, might still exist on the computer.

However, there are circumstances under which **Recuva** cannot retrieve information. If you have permanently deleted or *wiped* any temporary files by running **CCleaner** with the *Secure file deletion (Slower)* option enabled, those files are virtually unrecoverable. **Recuva** cannot recover files after programs like **CCleaner** or **Eraser** have been used to wipe free disk space or if **Windows** itself has already overwritten any previously occupied space. **Recuva** also cannot recover damaged documents and files.

**Recuva** can also be used to securely overwrite your private or sensitive data.
