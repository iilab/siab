## 5.0 FAQ and Review  ##

Elena and Nikolai find **Eraser** easy enough to use, but they both realise that it is a program which should be used with care, since items which are deleted in this way cannot be recovered. They feel that it is important to take the time to get to know the program properly before using it on a regular basis. **Eraser** seems to be working fine on Elena's machine, but they both still want to know a few more things about it. 

<div class="background" markdown="1"> 

***Q**: Can I use* **Eraser** *on files on my USB memory stick?*

***A**: Yes. You can wipe the files through using the* **Windows Explorer** *menu. And you can also wipe unused space on a USB memory stick by creating the appropriate task in **Eraser**.*

***Q**: If I don't want to use **Eraser**
anymore, is it easy to uninstall? If I do so, will it affect my
computer in any way? And will my files stay deleted?*

***A**: You can uninstall **Eraser** from the Start menu as follows:* **Select: Start &gt; Programs &gt; Eraser &gt; Uninstall Eraser**. *This
will not affect other programs on your computer in any way, and the
files you have wiped with **Eraser** will not be recoverable.*

***Q**: Are there any* **Windows** *files that **Eraser** does not wipe?*

***A**: All the files you can see in your
computer can be wiped. Even some files that you cannot see (such as
recoverable files in unused space) will be wiped if you set the right
options mentioned above.*

***Q**: Does **Eraser** wipe file names as well as the files themselves?*

***A**: Yes, all parts of the file are wiped, however you should use [**CCleaner**](/en/ccleaner_main) to wipe the recent documents list.*

***Q**: Will anyone ever be able to access the deleted files?*

***A**: Recovering data from files that have been overwritten is a highly complex and expensive process. It takes a disproportionate amount of time to recover a file that has only been overwritten once, let alone three to seven times. When using **Eraser** properly you may be sure that data has been securely deleted.*
