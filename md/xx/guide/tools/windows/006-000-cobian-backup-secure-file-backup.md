Archiving or performing a backup of your documents, files and folders could be as simple as copying files from one location to another secure location; for this, special tools are not required. However, when archiving greater numbers of documents and files, you will benefit from using either a specialized program to backup files (like **Cobian Backup**) or a *file synchronisation* tool, programs that ensure that both the original or ‘source’ location and the new location have exactly same content. Apart from **Cobian Backup**, there are many tools for helping you to archive or backup your documents; here is our recommended list as follows: 

- [**Freebyte Backup**](http://www.freebyte.com/fbbackup/) is a freeware backup program designed for **Microsoft Windows**;
- [**Unison File Synchronizer**](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) is a free and open source program for **Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, and GNU/Linux**;
- [**Allway Sync**](http://allwaysync.com/) is a freeware **Microsoft Windows** files synchronisation tool;
- [**FreeFileSync**](http://freefilesync.sourceforge.net/) is a free and open source files synchronisation tool for **GNU/Linux** and **Microsoft Windows**;
- [**Time Machine**](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Time_Machine_%28Mac_OS%29) is a backup utility developed by **Apple**, included with **Mac OS** (version 10.5 and up); and
- **Ubuntu GNU/Linux** users please read [**Backup Your System**](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem) guide describing tools you may use.

## 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ##

**Cobian Backup** is used to archive, (or to make a backup copy) of your files and directories. Backups can be stored in other directories or drives on your computer, other computers on the office network, or on removable devices (CDs, DVDs and USB memory sticks). **Cobian Backup** lets you archive your directories and files on a regular basis. It works silently in the background on your system (that is, in the system tray), checking your schedule and executing the backup process when
necessary. **Cobian Backup** can also compress and encrypt files as it generates the backup file.
