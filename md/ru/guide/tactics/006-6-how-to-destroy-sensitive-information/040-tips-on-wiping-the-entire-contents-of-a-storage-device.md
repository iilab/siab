title: Tips on wiping the entire contents of a storage device

---

You might occasionally need to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) a storage device completely. When you sell or give away an old computer, it is best to remove the hard drive and let the computer's new owner acquire one for herself. If this is not an option, however, you should at least [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) the drive thoroughly with [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser) before handing it over. And, even if you do keep the drive, you will probably want to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) it anyway, regardless of whether you intend to reuse or discard it. Similarly, if you purchase a new hard drive, you should [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) your old one after copying your data and making a secure backup. If you are intending to throw away or recycle an old drive, you should also consider destroying it physically. (Many computer support professionals recommend a few strong blows with a hammer before discarding any data-storage device that once contained sensitive information.)

In any of the situations described above, you will need to use [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser) to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) an entire hard drive, which is impossible as long as the operating system is running on that particular drive. The easiest way to get around this issue is to remove the drive and put it into an external USB 'drive enclosure,' which you can then plug into any computer with [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser) installed on it. At that point, you can delete the full contents of the external drive and then use [*Eraser*](/en/glossary#Eraser) to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) all of its unallocated space. Fortunately, this is not something you will have to do often, as it may take quite some time.

Rather than trying to [*wipe*](/en/glossary#Wiping) data that have been stored on a rewritable CD or DVD, it is often better to destroy the disc itself. If necessary, you can create a new one containing any information you wish to keep. And, of course, this is the only way to 'erase' content from a non-rewritable disc. It is surprisingly difficult to destroy the contents of a CD or DVD completely. You may have heard stories about information being recovered from such discs even after they were cut into small pieces. While these stories are true, reconstructing information in this way takes a great deal of time and expertise. You will have to judge for yourself whether or not someone is likely to expend that level of resources in order to access your data. Typically, a sturdy pair of scissors (or a very sturdy paper shredder) will do the job nicely. If you want to take extra precautions, you can mix up the resulting pieces and dispose of them in various locations far from your home or office.

Elena: I still have an old CD backup of the webserver logs, and I heard that you can erase a CD by putting it in the microwave. Somehow, though, it sounds like a really bad idea to me. Do people really do that? Does it work?

Nikolai: I imagine it destroys the data pretty effectively, but I wouldn't know, because I'd never put a CD in my microwave! You're right. That sounds like a terrible idea. Even if the metal doesn't damage your microwave or start a fire, I bet that plastic would give off some pretty unhealthy fumes. Come to think of it, I wouldn't recommend burning CDs in a fire, either.
