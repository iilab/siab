## 1.0 Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Portable Pidgin ##

Given that portable tools are *not* installed on a local computer, their
existence and use will remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your
external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe
as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware,
malware, spyware and viruses. 

There are no other differences between **Portable Pidgin** and the version designed to be installed on a local computer.
