**Twitter** is a social network in which people share information via 140-character *status updates*. These updates originally responded to the question "what are you doing now?", although it has since evolved as a means of spreading various types of information. Unlike **Facebook**, on **Twitter** you 'follow' other users who interest you, rather than people you actually know.

### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

**Twitter** states in its terms of service: “This license is you authorising us to make your Tweets available to the rest of the world and to let others do the same. But what’s yours is yours – you own your content.” Moreover, **Twitter** reserves the right to hand over your information to governments should a request be made.

Though **Twitter** is a website, many people interact with and manage **Twitter** via desktop and smartphone applications that are known as **Twitter** clients. If you use a **Twitter** client you should make sure it is connecting to the site securely, over an encrypted connection, see [**Keeping your webmail private**](/en/chapter_7_1) in [**Chapter 7: How to keep your Internet communication private**](/en/chapter-7).

Furthermore, like **Facebook**, many people use **Twitter** in conjunction with numerous other websites and applications in order to share status updates, photos, locations, links, and so forth. Using these applications pose many potential security vulnerabilities, and it is very important that the privacy settings on all other applications are made as secure as possible.

The United States' Department of Homeland Security monitors **Twitter** and other social networking sites and it is highly likely that other governments do so as well.
