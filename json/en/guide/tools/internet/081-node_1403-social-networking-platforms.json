Here, you can <strong>choose</strong> between making them available to the entire public, your <strong>Facebook</strong> friends, yourself only, or a custom group which you can determine. Note that you can also change this for individual status updates, so that you can decide which ones are public, which ones are for friends or which ones are for a specific group. It's also worth noting, though, that everything you post is recorded by <strong>Facebook</strong> (including when you select <em>Only Me</em>) and can be handed over by them to third parties.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> The second option allows you to <strong>review</strong> the posts which other <strong>Facebook</strong> users have tagged you in. To see this, <strong>click</strong> on <em>Use Activity Log</em>.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/facebook-all-18.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 3: Who can see your future posts</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> The thrid option allows you to <strong>restrict</strong> access to previous status updates of yours which may have been public. <strong>Note</strong>, however, the limitation that individuals  you tagged and their friends will still be able to see this content.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/facebook-all-19.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 4: Limit previous posts</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can contact me?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 6</strong>. In this section, you can decide who is able to send you a friend request. This is not particularly important in terms of information security, since in the end, it is still you who decides who to accept as a friend, and you should always exercise caution and avoid adding people who are unknown or untrusted. If you want to change this setting, <strong>click</strong> <em>Edit</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 7.</strong> <em>Whose messages do I want filtered into my inbox?</em>: <strong>Facebook</strong> allows you to filter the messages you receive into two folders: <em>Inbox</em> and <em>Other</em>. Here you can <strong>choose</strong> between Basic Filtering, which is more permissive of messages from people who are not on your friend list, and Strict Filtering, which is less permissive.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/facebook-all-20.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 5: Who can contact me?</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who can look me up?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 8.</strong> Here, you can limit the ease with which people can look you up by knowing your phone number or e-mail address (although this is still technically possible), as well as limiting people's ability to find your <strong>Facebook</strong> page via search engines. The default settings make it as easy as possible for individuals to find you this way, including possible adversaries. <strong>Click</strong> <em>Edit</em> on the first two options and ensure that only <strong>Friends</strong> can search for you by your e-mail address and phone number.

Here, you can **choose** between making them available to the entire public, your **Facebook** friends, yourself only, or a custom group which you can determine. Note that you can also change this for individual status updates, so that you can decide which ones are public, which ones are for friends or which ones are for a specific group. It's also worth noting, though, that everything you post is recorded by **Facebook** (including when you select *Only Me*) and can be handed over by them to third parties.\r\n\r\n**Step 4.** The second option allows you to **review** the posts which other **Facebook** users have tagged you in. To see this, **click** on *Use Activity Log*.\r\n\r\n![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/facebook-all-18.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 3: Who can see your future posts*\r\n\r\n**Step 5.** The thrid option allows you to **restrict** access to previous status updates of yours which may have been public. **Note**, however, the limitation that individuals  you tagged and their friends will still be able to see this content.\r\n\r\n![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/facebook-all-19.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 4: Limit previous posts*\r\n\r\n**Who can contact me?**\r\n\r\n**Step 6**. In this section, you can decide who is able to send you a friend request. This is not particularly important in terms of information security, since in the end, it is still you who decides who to accept as a friend, and you should always exercise caution and avoid adding people who are unknown or untrusted. If you want to change this setting, **click** *Edit*.\r\n\r\n**Step 7.** *Whose messages do I want filtered into my inbox?*: **Facebook** allows you to filter the messages you receive into two folders: *Inbox* and *Other*. Here you can **choose** between Basic Filtering, which is more permissive of messages from people who are not on your friend list, and Strict Filtering, which is less permissive.  \r\n\r\n![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/facebook-all-20.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 5: Who can contact me?*\r\n\r\n**Who can look me up?**\r\n\r\n**Step 8.** Here, you can limit the ease with which people can look you up by knowing your phone number or e-mail address (although this is still technically possible), as well as limiting people's ability to find your **Facebook** page via search engines.

As a result, **YouTube** is not always a good place to keeping your video safe. **Google** has also been known to give in to pressure to remove content from **YouTube** in order to avoid having the site blocked in a particular country. So, if you want people to see your video, put a copy of it on **YouTube**. Just don't put your *only* copy on **YouTube**.\r\n\r\nThe content you post on **YouTube** remains yours. By posting it on **YouTube**, you are giving **Google** a license to distribute it.\r\n\r\n**YouTube** is or has been reported to be inaccessible in various countries, including:\r\n\r\n*  China \r\n*  Burma \r\n*  Iran \r\n*  Libya\r\n*  Syria \r\n*  Uzbekistan\r\n*  Tunisia\r\n*  Turkmenistan\r\n*  Turkey\r\n\r\nSee [**the traffic section of Google's Transparency Report**](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/) for more details about current and past censorship and other disruptions.
