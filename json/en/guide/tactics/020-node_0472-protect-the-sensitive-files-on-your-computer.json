If your Windows password doesn't protect you from intruders, how can it protect you from other people with accounts on the same computer? In fact, your My Documents folder is normally visible to anybody, so other users wouldn't even have to do anything clever to read your unencrypted files. You're right, though, even if the folder is made 'private,' you're still not safe unless you use some kind of encryption."

Plus, anybody who gets his hands on your computer for long enough to restart it with a LiveCD in the drive can copy your data without even having to worry about the password. If they manage to take it away for a while, then you're in even worse trouble. It's not just Windows passwords you need to worry about, either.

While it may be true that no one else can read it, an intruder will know that it is there, and that you have taken steps to protect it. This exposes you to various non-technical methods through which that intruder might attempt to gain access, such as intimidation, blackmail, interrogation and torture. It is in this context that <a href=\"/en/glossary#TrueCrypt\"><em>TrueCrypt's</em></a> deniability feature, which is discussed in more detail below, comes into play.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/en/glossary#TrueCrypt\"><em>TrueCrypt's</em></a> deniability feature is one of the ways in which it goes beyond what is typically offered by file <a href=\"/en/glossary#Encryption\"><em>encryption</em></a> tools. This feature can be thought of as a peculiar form of <a href=\"/en/glossary#Steganography\"><em>steganography</em></a> that disguises your most sensitive information as other, less sensitive, hidden data. It is analogous to installing a subtle 'false bottom' inside that not-so-subtle office safe. If an intruder steals your key, or intimidates you into giving her the safe's combination, she will find some convincing 'decoy' material, but not the information that you truly care about protecting.</p>\n\n<p>Only you know that your safe contains a hidden compartment in the back. This allows you to 'deny' that you are keeping any secrets beyond what you have already given to the intruder, and might help protect you in situations where you must reveal a password for some reason. Such reasons might include legal or physical threats to your own safety, or that of your colleagues, associates, friends and family members. The purpose of deniability is to give you a chance of escaping from a potentially dangerous situation even if you choose to continue protecting your data.

                                        "value": "Often, you may be less concerned about the consequences of 'getting caught' with [*encryption*](/en/glossary#Encryption) software on your computer or USB memory stick and more concerned that your encrypted volume will indicate precisely where you store the information that you most wish to protect. While it may be true that no one else can read it, an intruder will know that it is there, and that you have taken steps to protect it. This exposes you to various non-technical methods through which that intruder might attempt to gain access, such as intimidation, blackmail, interrogation and torture. It is in this context that [*TrueCrypt's*](/en/glossary#TrueCrypt) deniability feature, which is discussed in more detail below, comes into play.\r\n\r\n[*TrueCrypt's*](/en/glossary#TrueCrypt) deniability feature is one of the ways in which it goes beyond what is typically offered by file [*encryption*](/en/glossary#Encryption) tools. This feature can be thought of as a peculiar form of [*steganography*](/en/glossary#Steganography) that disguises your most sensitive information as other, less sensitive, hidden data. It is analogous to installing a subtle 'false bottom' inside that not-so-subtle office safe. If an intruder steals your key, or intimidates you into giving her the safe's combination, she will find some convincing 'decoy' material, but not the information that you truly care about protecting.\r\n\r\nOnly you know that your safe contains a hidden compartment in the back. This allows you to 'deny' that you are keeping any secrets beyond what you have already given to the intruder, and might help protect you in situations where you must reveal a password for some reason. Such reasons might include legal or physical threats to your own safety, or that of your colleagues, associates, friends and family members. The purpose of deniability is to give you a chance of escaping from a potentially dangerous situation even if you choose to continue protecting your data.
