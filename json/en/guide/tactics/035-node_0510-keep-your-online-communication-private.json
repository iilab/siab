After spending several months collecting testimonies from witnesses to the human rights violations that have been committed by the military in their region, Claudia and Pablo have begun taking steps to protect the resulting data. They have kept only the information they need, which they store in a TrueCrypt partition that is backed up in several physical locations. While preparing to publish certain aspects of these testimonies in a report, they have found that they must discuss sensitive information with a few of their colleagues in another country. Although they have agreed not to mention names or locations, they still want to ensure that their email and instant messaging conversations on this topic remain private. After calling a meeting to discuss the importance of communication security, Claudia has asked if anyone in the office has questions."

The first is to make sure that only the person to whom you send a given message is able to read it.

Going beyond the basics, it is sometimes critical that your email contacts have the ability to verify that a particular message truly came from you and not from someone who might be attempting to impersonate you. One way to accomplish this is described under <a href=\"secure-communication#505\"><em>Advanced email security</em></a>, in the <a href=\"secure-communication#508\"><em>Encrypting and authenticating individual email messages</em></a> section.</p>\n\n<p>You should also know what to do if you think the privacy of your email account may have been violated.

First, do they offer a secure connection to your account? Gmail does, so you're OK there. Second, do you trust the administrators to keep your email private and not to read through it or share it with others? That one's up to you. And, finally, you need to think about whether or not it's acceptable for you to be identified with that provider. In other words, will it get you in trouble to use an email address that ends in 'riseup.net', which is known to be popular among activists, or do you need a more typical 'gmail.com' address?\r\n"

Luckily, there are programs that can help secure the privacy of your chat sessions. Just like with email, though, a secure communications channel requires that both you and your instant messaging contacts use the same software and take the same security precautions.\r\n\r\nThere is a chat program called [*Pidgin*](/en/glossary#Pidgin) that supports many existing instant messaging protocols, which means that you can easily begin using it without having to change your account name or recreate your list of contacts. In order to have private, [*encrypted*](/en/glossary#Encryption) conversations through [*Pidgin*](/en/glossary#Pidgin) , you will need to install and activate the *Off-the-Record [*OTR*](/en/glossary#OTR)* plug-in. Fortunately, this is a fairly simple process. \r\n"

You encode messages to a given email contact using her special 'public key', which she can distribute freely. Then, she uses her secret 'private key', which she has to guard carefully, in order to read those messages. In turn, your contact uses your public key to encrypt messages that she writes to you. So, in the end, you do have to exchange public keys, but you can share them openly, without having to worry about the fact that anybody who wants your public key can get it.\r\n"
