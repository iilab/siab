Information is vulnerable in many ways:\r\n\r\n* **Information is vulnerable when sent from a mobile phone **<br> Example: Each mobile phone provider has full access to all text and voice messages sent via its network. Phone providers in most countries are legally obliged to keep records of all communications. In some countries the phone providers are under the monopoly control of government. Voice and text communication can also be tapped by third parties in proximity to the mobile phone, using inexpensive equipment.\r\n\r\n* **Information is vulnerable within the sender's and the recipient's phones**<br>  Example: Mobile phones can store all sorts of data: call history, text messages sent and received, address book information, photos, video clips, text files. These data may reveal your network of contacts, and personal information about you and your colleagues. Securing this information is difficult, even – on some phones – impossible.\r\nModern mobile phones are pocket-sized computers. With more features comes higher risk. In addition, phones that connect to the internet are also subject to the insecurities of computers and of the internet.\r\n\r\n* **Phones give out information about their location**<br>  Example: As part of normal operation, every mobile phone automatically and regularly informs the phone service provider where it is at that moment. What's more, many phones nowadays have [GPS]](/en/glossary#GPS) functions, and this precise location information may be embedded in other data such as photos, SMS and internet requests that are sent from the phone.\r\n\r\n**The evolution of technology brings more features, but also more risks.**\r\n"

Did you sign up with your own ID?\r\n\r\n***Borna:*** No, I just got a second-hand phone from your uncle's shop; he says he made sure it is clean and safe to use.

The phone company tracks each call or transmission with the phone's number, and the SIM card identification number, AND the phone's identification number.

Then, as you start your meeting, it would start acting like a recording and transmitting device.\r\n\r\n***Borna:*** No! really?.\r\n\r\n***Delir:*** Well, it is pretty easily done technologically. But none of that can happen if the battery is disconnected, so you will be safe in this unlikely case.\r\n\r\n***Borna:*** I guess I will just not take it with me if I want to be super careful. But I wonder if I should use this thing at all then?\r\n\r\n***Delir:*** Please, father. You used to tell me not to be afraid of new things. Mobiles are like that, you just have to know what the benefits and risks are. Just be careful. If you know the risks, you can take steps to avoid them."

As long as you have your phone with you, charged and ready to use, it will keep track of where you go, and talk to the towers of the network nearby, simply because it has to. So at any given time, your location is somewhere between the closest towers of the phone network.\r\n\r\n***Borna:*** So I should turn it off until I get there?\r\n\r\n***Delir:*** Well, of course the best thing to do is not to take it with you. The next best thing is for you to have it switched off AND take the battery out of it before you go, and not turn it on until you get back.\r\n\r\n***Borna:*** What? isn't it enough to turn it off?\r\n\r\n***Delir:*** Well, to be on the safe side, you should take the battery out, and here's why: this is a transmission device, and as long as the battery is connected, there is a small chance that somehow someone may turn it on without your knowledge."

Also you should find out exactly what the capabilities of your phone are, in order to be certain that you have taken appropriate measures:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Do not store confidential files and photos on your mobile phone. Move them, as soon as you can, to a safe location, as discussed in our guide <a href=\"secure-file-storage\"><strong>How to Protect Files on Your Computer</strong></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Frequently erase your phone call records, messages, address book entries, photos, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you use your phone to browse the internet, follow safe practices similar to those you use when you are on the computer (e.g. always send information over encrypted connection like <a href=\"/en/glossary#SSL\">HTTPS</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free. See our guide <a href=\"malware\"><strong><em>How to Protect Your Computer From Malware and Hackers</em></strong></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do not accept and install unknown and unverified programmes on your phone, including ring tones, wallpaper, <a href=\"/en/glossary#Java\">java applications</a> or any others that originate from an unwanted and unexpected source. They may contain viruses, malicious software or spying programmes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Observe your phone's behaviour and functioning. Look out for unknown programmes and running processes, strange messages and unstable operation. If you don't know or use some of the features and applications on your phone, disable or uninstall them if you can.</p></li>\n<li><p>Be wary when connecting to WiFi access points that don't provide passwords, just as you would when using your computer and connecting to WiFi access points. The mobile phone is essentially like a computer and thus shares the vulnerabilities and insecurities that affect computers and the internet.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure communication channels like <a href=\"/en/glossary#IrDA\">Infrared (IrDA)</a>, <a href=\"/en/glossary#Bluetooth\">Bluetooth</a> and Wireless Internet (WiFi) on your phone are switched off and disabled if you are not using them. Switch them on only when they are required. Use them only in trusted situations and locations. Consider not using Bluetooth, as it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on this form of communication. Instead, transfer data using a cable connection from the phone to handsfree headphones or to a computer.</p></li>\n</ul>",

Also you should find out exactly what the capabilities of your phone are, in order to be certain that you have taken appropriate measures:\r\n\r\n* Do not store confidential files and photos on your mobile phone. Move them, as soon as you can, to a safe location, as discussed in our guide [**How to Protect Files on Your Computer**](secure-file-storage).\r\n\r\n* Frequently erase your phone call records, messages, address book entries, photos, etc.\r\n\r\n* If you use your phone to browse the internet, follow safe practices similar to those you use when you are on the computer (e.g. always send information over encrypted connection like [HTTPS](/en/glossary#SSL)).\r\n\r\n* Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free. See our guide [***How to Protect Your Computer From Malware and Hackers***](malware).\r\n\r\n* Do not accept and install unknown and unverified programmes on your phone, including ring tones, wallpaper, [java applications](/en/glossary#Java) or any others that originate from an unwanted and unexpected source. They may contain viruses, malicious software or spying programmes.\r\n\r\n* Observe your phone's behaviour and functioning. Look out for unknown programmes and running processes, strange messages and unstable operation. If you don't know or use some of the features and applications on your phone, disable or uninstall them if you can.\r\n\r\n* Be wary when connecting to WiFi access points that don't provide passwords, just as you would when using your computer and connecting to WiFi access points. The mobile phone is essentially like a computer and thus shares the vulnerabilities and insecurities that affect computers and the internet.\r\n\r\n* Make sure communication channels like [Infrared (IrDA)](/en/glossary#IrDA), [Bluetooth](/en/glossary#Bluetooth) and Wireless Internet (WiFi) on your phone are switched off and disabled if you are not using them. Switch them on only when they are required. Use them only in trusted situations and locations. Consider not using Bluetooth, as it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on this form of communication. Instead, transfer data using a cable connection from the phone to handsfree headphones or to a computer."
