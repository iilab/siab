She has been collecting documents, media files and geographic information about logging for years, and most of it is stored on an old Windows computer in the office of the NGO where she works. While designing a website around this information, she has come to realize its importance and to worry about preserving it in the event that her computer should be damaged, especially if it should happen before she gets everything copied up to the website. Other members of her organization sometimes use the computer, so she also wants to learn how to restore her files if someone accidentally deletes the folder containing her work. She asks her nephew **Nikolai** to help her develop a backup strategy."

Your email, for example, may be stored on the provider's mail server, on your own computer, or in both places at once. And, of course, you might have several email accounts. Then, there are important documents on the computers you use, which may be in the office or at home. There are address books, chat histories and personal program settings. It is also possible that some information is stored on removable media as well, including USB memory sticks, portable hard drives, CDs, DVDs, and old floppy disks. Your mobile phone contains a list of contacts and may have important text messages stored in it. If you have a website, it may contain a large collection of articles built up over years of work. And, finally, don't forget your non-digital information, such as paper notebooks, diaries and letters.</p>\n\n<p>Next, you need to define which of these files are 'master copies,' and which are duplicates. The master copy is generally the most up-to-date version of a particular file or collection of files, and corresponds to copy that you would actually edit if you needed to update the content. Obviously, this distinction does not apply to files of which you have only one copy, but it is extremely important for certain types of information. One common disaster scenario occurs when only duplicates of an important document are backed up, and the master copy itself gets lost or destroyed before those duplicates can be updated. Imagine, for example, that you have been travelling for a week while updating the copy of a particular spreadsheet that you keep on your USB memory stick.

                                        "value": "The first step to formulating a *backup policy* is to picture where your personal and work information is currently located. Your email, for example, may be stored on the provider's mail server, on your own computer, or in both places at once. And, of course, you might have several email accounts. Then, there are important documents on the computers you use, which may be in the office or at home. There are address books, chat histories and personal program settings. It is also possible that some information is stored on removable media as well, including USB memory sticks, portable hard drives, CDs, DVDs, and old floppy disks. Your mobile phone contains a list of contacts and may have important text messages stored in it. If you have a website, it may contain a large collection of articles built up over years of work. And, finally, don't forget your non-digital information, such as paper notebooks, diaries and letters.\r\n\r\nNext, you need to define which of these files are 'master copies,' and which are duplicates. The master copy is generally the most up-to-date version of a particular file or collection of files, and corresponds to copy that you would actually edit if you needed to update the content. Obviously, this distinction does not apply to files of which you have only one copy, but it is extremely important for certain types of information. One common disaster scenario occurs when only duplicates of an important document are backed up, and the master copy itself gets lost or destroyed before those duplicates can be updated. Imagine, for example, that you have been travelling for a week while updating the copy of a particular spreadsheet that you keep on your USB memory stick. At this point, you should begin thinking of that copy as your master copy, because the periodic, automated backups of the outdated version on your office computer are no longer useful.\r\n\r\nTry to write down the physical location of all master and duplicate copies of the information identified above.

Honestly, how many documents per week would you be willing to back up like that? Plus, you need to consider whether or not those attachments are safe, especially if you're at all worried about your email being monitored. Unless you're connecting to Gmail securely, this is a bit like handing over your sensitive information on a silver platter. Using an HTTPS connection to Gmail in order to back up small Truecrypt volumes or KeePass database files would be pretty safe, because they're encrypted, but I really wouldn't recommend this as a general-purpose backup strategy."

Also most webmail services will provide instructions on how to use such programs and, often, how to import your email addresses into them. You can learn more about this in the Further Reading section, below.

Essentially, you need to make sure that each data type is stored in at least two separate locations.\r\n\r\n**Electronic documents** - Create a full backup of the documents on your computer using a program like [*Cobian Backup*](/en/glossary#Cobian_Backup), which is described in more detail below. Store the backup on something portable so that you can take it home or to some other safe location. External hard drives, CD/DVDs or USB memory sticks are possible choices. Some people use CDs or DVDs for this, since the risk of overwriting and losing your backup is lower. Blank CDs may be cheap enough to allow you to use a new one every time you make a backup.\r\n\r\nBecause this category of data often contains the most sensitive information, it is particularly important that you protect your electronic document backups using encryption. You can learn how to do this in [***How to protect the sensitive files on your computer***](secure-file-storage) and in the [***TrueCrypt Guide***](truecrypt/windows).\r\n\r\n**Program databases** - Once you have determined the location of your program databases, you can back them up in the same way as electronic documents.\r\n\r\n**Email** - Rather than accessing your email only through a web browser, install an email client like [*Thunderbird*](/en/glossary#Thunderbird) and configure it to work with your account. The [***Thunderbird Guide***](thunderbird/windows) explains in detail how to do this. Also most webmail services will provide instructions on how to use such programs and, often, how to import your email addresses into them. You can learn more about this in the Further Reading section, below. If you choose to move your old email messages to your computer so they are not stored on the server (e.g. for security reasons), make sure that you include them in the backup of electronic documents described above.\r\n\r\n**Mobile phone contents** - To back up the phone numbers and text messages on your mobile phone, you can connect it to your computer using the appropriate software, which is generally available from the website of the company that manufactured your phone. You may need to buy a special USB cable to do this.\r\n\r\n**Printed documents** - Where possible, you should scan all of your important papers, then back them up along with your other electronic documents, as discussed above.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you should have rearranged your storage devices, data types and backups in a way that makes your information much more resistant to disaster:\r\n\r\n\r\n| Data Type                                             | Master/Duplicate | Storage Device                     | Location |\r\n| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ |\r\n| Electronic documents                             | Master               | Computer hard drive              | Office     |\r\n| Electronic documents                             | Duplicate           | CDs                                     | Home     |\r\n| A few important electronic documents      | Duplicate           | USB memory stick                | With me |\r\n| Program databases                                | Master               | Computer hard drive               | Office     |\r\n| Program databases                                | Duplicate           | CDs                                      | Home     |\r\n| Email & email contacts                          | Master               | Gmail account                       | Internet   |\r\n| Email & email contacts                          | Duplicate           | Thunderbird on office computer | Office     |\r\n| Text messages & mobile phone contacts | Master               | Mobile phone                         | With me |\r\n| Text messages & mobile phone contacts | Duplicate           | Computer hard drive                | Office     |\r\n| Text messages & mobile phone contacts | Duplicate           | Backup SIM card                    | Home     |\r\n| Printed documents                                 | Master               | Desk drawer                          | Office     |\r\n| Scanned documents                               | Duplicate           | CDs                                      | Home     |\r\n"

Computer, desk, backup CDs and all? Or, what if your website forum gets used to plan some giant environmental demonstration, the authorities crack down, things get out of hand, and the organisation is raided?
