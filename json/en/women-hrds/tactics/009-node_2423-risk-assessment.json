The misogynistic attacks, threats, intimidation, and policing experienced by women are real, harmful, and alarming. It is our collective responsibility as different internet stakeholders to prevent, respond to, and resist this violence.\"</em>  <a href=\"https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/A_feminist_internet_and_its_reflection_on_privacy,_security,_policy_and_violence_against_Women\">2</a></p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, as a women human rights defender you cannot always count on the full support of your state, your society, or at times even your family. Your work to defend women's rights is often a direct challenge to power structures, whether in government, society or the family, and directly threatens those who currently wield that power.</p>\n\n<p>As a women's rights defender, you are often challenging patriarchal structures and demanding rights for equality in areas which have been misappropriated to serve masculine power structures.  It can also mean confronting engendered technologies that have been created without conscious regard for women’s rights and gender equality.  <a href=\"http://ignite.globalfundforwomen.org/gallery/there-such-thing-feminist-technology\">3</a></p>\n\n<p>This means that a number of different actors may take action against you to hinder or stop your work. In some cases it may be individuals or groups who disagree with women having a voice and opinion online.  This can also be on a personal level where intimate partners use pictures and other information to harass, or blackmail you, reinforcing stereotypes and exemplifying gender-based violence.</p>\n\n<p>Getting a sense of who these actors are will help you to understand the nature of the threats to yourself, your community and your information. Different actors will pose different threats to your security, and indeed your digital security: while the state, for example, may have the capacity to listen to your mobile calls, or place viruses on your computer to monitor your online activities, non-state actors or even common criminals could gather a huge amount of information about you by just monitoring your Facebook page, if everything is open and public. If you think about what you are up against, you can take the right measures to keep them guessing, and keep working.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supporting forces</strong></p>\n\n<p>As part of this 'actor mapping' exercise, you should also consider the actors who are on your side, whether local, regional or international: these could include friends, community members, police, other organisations, embassies and so on. It will be important for you to spread your digital security practices among your allies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Unknown forces</strong></p>\n\n<p>Finally you should also consider the actors whose intentions are unknown, but who are relevant to your safety. An example may be your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or companies such as Facebook or Google, on whom we depend for a lot of our online activities and who may collect and store a lot of information about us. For example, an ISP, social network or e-mail provider could be legally pressured by a government to hand over information such as your browsing history, chat logs or emails. Due to the large amount of information they collect about your activities, they may also be targets for malicious hackers who want to access that information about you.</p>\n", 
                                        "value": "In order to understand the risks we face and be able to effectively react, first we should know where they come from; that is to say, who is behind them, and why. \r\n\r\nIn order to 'map' the actors relevant to our work and our well-being, we might consider dividing them into three categories:\r\n\r\n- **Resisting forces**: These are actors who try to prevent us from successfully carrying out our work.\r\n- **Supporting forces**: These are our friends and allies, who try to support our project in one way or another.\r\n- **Unknown forces**: These are other actors whose exact intentions, with regard to our security and the success of our work, are unknown or ambiguous.\r\n\r\n**Resisting forces** \r\n\r\n*“Violence online and tech-related violence are part of the continuum of gender-based violence. The misogynistic attacks, threats, intimidation, and policing experienced by women are real, harmful, and alarming. It is our collective responsibility as different internet stakeholders to prevent, respond to, and resist this violence.\"*  [2](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/A_feminist_internet_and_its_reflection_on_privacy,_security,_policy_and_violence_against_Women) \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as a women human rights defender you cannot always count on the full support of your state, your society, or at times even your family. Your work to defend women's rights is often a direct challenge to power structures, whether in government, society or the family, and directly threatens those who currently wield that power.\r\n\r\nAs a women's rights defender, you are often challenging patriarchal structures and demanding rights for equality in areas which have been misappropriated to serve masculine power structures.  It can also mean confronting engendered technologies that have been created without conscious regard for women’s rights and gender equality.  [3](http://ignite.globalfundforwomen.org/gallery/there-such-thing-feminist-technology)\r\n\r\nThis means that a number of different actors may take action against you to hinder or stop your work. In some cases it may be individuals or groups who disagree with women having a voice and opinion online.  This can also be on a personal level where intimate partners use pictures and other information to harass, or blackmail you, reinforcing stereotypes and exemplifying gender-based violence.\r\n\r\nGetting a sense of who these actors are will help you to understand the nature of the threats to yourself, your community and your information. Different actors will pose different threats to your security, and indeed your digital security: while the state, for example, may have the capacity to listen to your mobile calls, or place viruses on your computer to monitor your online activities, non-state actors or even common criminals could gather a huge amount of information about you by just monitoring your Facebook page, if everything is open and public. If you think about what you are up against, you can take the right measures to keep them guessing, and keep working.\r\n\r\n**Supporting forces**\r\n\r\nAs part of this 'actor mapping' exercise, you should also consider the actors who are on your side, whether local, regional or international: these could include friends, community members, police, other organisations, embassies and so on. It will be important for you to spread your digital security practices among your allies. \r\n\r\n**Unknown forces**\r\n\r\nFinally you should also consider the actors whose intentions are unknown, but who are relevant to your safety. An example may be your Internet Service Provider (ISP) or companies such as Facebook or Google, on whom we depend for a lot of our online activities and who may collect and store a lot of information about us. For example, an ISP, social network or e-mail provider could be legally pressured by a government to hand over information such as your browsing history, chat logs or emails. Due to the large amount of information they collect about your activities, they may also be targets for malicious hackers who want to access that information about you.\r\n\r\n"
