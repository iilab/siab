We then use this to collect money from them\" said one of the young men. \r\n\r\nThe Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya [say](http://irasciblemusings.com/nairobi-police-say-closeted-gays-being-blackmailed-and-attacked-by-gangs-2/) incidents of blackmail and extortion are high and constantly growing within the country and accounts for one of the highest crimes committed against LGBTI persons.\r\n\r\n***Human Rights Defender Testimonies***\r\n\r\n*\"If you go on some social network and you let people know you're a lesbian, or even if you don't and some guy would just pretend that he's a girl and you think you're talking to a girl, you start exchanging pictures and he keeps all the pictures. He would even send a nude picture of a girl! I met someone on Badoo once, we were talking, so I said 'give me your number', but I couldn't call immediately.

What made me able to handle this kind of infiltrations was first to check for how long the person has been registered. Then if they are a new registeration, I start to wonder why are they trying to friend me. Secondly, there are people you only have one common friend and that common friend is so remote, so that is also a bad sign. Then when I go to photos and I see only one photo or 4 photos maximum, ahhh! Sometimes, I see that they are all profile pictures of different people and those people don’t even look the same. It gives me a hint that the photos have been stolen or photoshopped to give people a false impression that. I have learnt to really check before giving people access to me.\"*\r\n— Anonymous Human Rights Defender\r\n"

Moreover, our identities and work often fly in the face of heteronormative social structures and misogyny. As a result, **the violence faced by LGBTI people is structural, physical, and often sexualised**. Harassment, violence, rape, and in some cases murder have been recorded against members of the community.\r\n\r\nNow, many of these threats have expanded into the online space. Online bullying is a form of harrasment which may include repeatedly taunting, ganging up, threatening, or name calling individuls to cause harm or discomfort. Because of the proliferation of social networking and communication platforms, and the fact that people often feel anonymous when using them, online and social media bullying are very prevalent and LGBTI persons and groups are not exempt from it. On the contrary, a lot of people have been 'outed' to their family because of their posts and behaviour online while others have been harrassed for being LGBTI, posting LGBTI-related content or showing support for the community. Seemingly random conversations have been known to turn into homophobic threads and in a some situations, what begins as online harassment turns into real-life violence.\r\n"
