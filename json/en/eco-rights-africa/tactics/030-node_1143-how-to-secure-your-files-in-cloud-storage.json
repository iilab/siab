Most of the popular cloud services such as Dropbox and Google Drive are generally thought to be fraught with security and privacy problems.</p>\n\n<p>There are, however, several free and more secure alternative cloud services out there. <strong>Tresorit</strong> and <strong>SpiderOak</strong> offer free, security-conscious services which are worth considering.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tresorit.com/cloud-storage?utm_expid=64271970-17.9vVc2aJAS_yLy3UvioIh5A.1\">Tresorit</a>: 5GB of storage free, although you can only store files not exceeding 500MB. Since the capacity is so small, the free service would be useful in keeping only the most sensitive of your information. The paid-for service is relatively affordable.</p>\n\n<p>Tresorit security is threefold: Your files are encrypted on your computer (thus eliminating the need for you to encrypt your files manually) before being uploaded onto the cloud; the company does not have access to your files and cannot modify them; and the company does not know your password (the flip side of this is that if you forget your password you lose control of your files and you can never recover them).</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of Tresorit over other popular cloud services is that you do not have to create a special sync folder for it, you just right-click any folder and “tresor it” to sync it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>To use Tresorit, you have to download the desktop application. Their support page has straightforward instructions to guide you on <a href=\"https://support.tresorit.com/forums/23076308-Getting-Started-Basic-and-Premium\">how to install and use Tresorit</a></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://spideroak.com/\">SpiderOak</a> is free for the first 2GB of storage space but after that you have to pay for more storage. You can store anything from documents and photos to video and audio files.</p>\n\n<p>With SpiderOak, everything is password-secured and only you (or those who have your password or who you share the folders or files with) can access them. Even the SpiderOak servers cannot read your files.</p>\n\n<p>Their “zero-knowledge” policy means they know neither your password nor the content of your folders. In their own words, “In technical terms, ‘zero-knowledge’ means that the server has 'zero-knowledge' of your data. In non-technical terms it means that your data is 100% private and only readable to you. No plaintext data is stored on our servers, ensuring absolute confidentiality between you and your data.”</p>\n\n<p><strong>Caution: When using zero-knowledge cloud services, ensure that you can always remember your password since they cannot reset it even in times of emergency. If you cannot remember your password, you will completely lose access to your folders. You can use <a href=\"keepass/windows\">KeePass to keep your passwords</a> in one secure place</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>You need a desktop application to be able to use SpiderOak. The SpiderOak website has a detailed User Manual that shows <a href=\"https://spideroak.com/support#manual-spideroakone-ribbon\">how to install and use SpiderOak</a></strong>.</p>\n",

Most of the popular cloud services such as Dropbox and Google Drive are generally thought to be fraught with security and privacy problems. \r\n\r\nThere are, however, several free and more secure alternative cloud services out there. **Tresorit** and **SpiderOak** offer free, security-conscious services which are worth considering.\r\n\r\n[Tresorit](https://tresorit.com/cloud-storage?utm_expid=64271970-17.9vVc2aJAS_yLy3UvioIh5A.1): 5GB of storage free, although you can only store files not exceeding 500MB. Since the capacity is so small, the free service would be useful in keeping only the most sensitive of your information. The paid-for service is relatively affordable. \r\n\r\nTresorit security is threefold: Your files are encrypted on your computer (thus eliminating the need for you to encrypt your files manually) before being uploaded onto the cloud; the company does not have access to your files and cannot modify them; and the company does not know your password (the flip side of this is that if you forget your password you lose control of your files and you can never recover them). \r\n\r\nThe advantage of Tresorit over other popular cloud services is that you do not have to create a special sync folder for it, you just right-click any folder and “tresor it” to sync it.\r\n\r\n**To use Tresorit, you have to download the desktop application. Their support page has straightforward instructions to guide you on [how to install and use Tresorit](https://support.tresorit.com/forums/23076308-Getting-Started-Basic-and-Premium)**.\r\n\r\n[SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/) is free for the first 2GB of storage space but after that you have to pay for more storage. You can store anything from documents and photos to video and audio files.\r\n\r\nWith SpiderOak, everything is password-secured and only you (or those who have your password or who you share the folders or files with) can access them. Even the SpiderOak servers cannot read your files.\r\n\r\nTheir “zero-knowledge” policy means they know neither your password nor the content of your folders. In their own words, “In technical terms, ‘zero-knowledge’ means that the server has 'zero-knowledge' of your data. In non-technical terms it means that your data is 100% private and only readable to you. No plaintext data is stored on our servers, ensuring absolute confidentiality between you and your data.”\r\n\r\n**Caution: When using zero-knowledge cloud services, ensure that you can always remember your password since they cannot reset it even in times of emergency. If you cannot remember your password, you will completely lose access to your folders. You can use [KeePass to keep your passwords](keepass/windows) in one secure place**.\r\n\r\n**You need a desktop application to be able to use SpiderOak.
