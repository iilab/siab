You both need to use an <strong>IRC</strong> or a <strong>ICQ</strong> account for example. However, services that use <strong>XMPP</strong> protocol (like <strong>RiseUp</strong>, <strong>Google Talk</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, or other <strong>XMPP</strong> servers) may allow chatting between their accounts. Therefore you can chat between account on <strong>RiseUp</strong> and <strong>Google Talk</strong>.

That's the beauty of using a multi-protocol <strong>IM</strong> client.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Q</em></strong>: How may I access my Pidgin-OTR account on another computer?</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>A</em></strong>: One way is to generate a new private key to use with your <strong>IM</strong> account on that computer.

First of all, if you forget your password and you will not be able to reset it using options offered by the account provider, you will have to generate a new <strong>IM</strong> account.

If someone has somehow obtained your <strong>IM</strong> password, that person could attempt to impersonate you when using <strong>Pidgin</strong>. Fortunately, he/she won't be able to authenticate the session without having your encryption keys or knowing your shared code word. As such, your buddy may become suspicious.
