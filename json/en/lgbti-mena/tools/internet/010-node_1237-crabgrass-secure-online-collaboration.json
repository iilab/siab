You can choose any image you like, it doesn't have to actually show you. However, you should be sure that you don't use a copyrighted image. If you prefer you also have the choice not to have a profile picture. \r\n\r\nTo upload a picture click ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/crab17_uploadimage.png), choose a picture from your computer or copy and paste the URL of an image you would like to use that is already online and click ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/crab18_uploadimage2.png). \r\n\r\nYour picture will be cropped and stretched to 96 pixels square. If you would like to use an image that has a different size and you want to make sure that a specific section of it becomes your profile picture you might want to crop and resize it manually before you upload it.\r\n\r\nIf you want to change the picture later you can either upload a different one following the steps described above or simply click ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/crab19_removeimage.png) to remove it.\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. You can **change your username** by entering a different one into the field *Username*. However, be aware that this is going to change all URLs for your account. If you have not told anyone yet about your new Crabgrass account this is not a problem. But if you have already made friends or shared pages created within Crabgrass be sure to let everybody know about the change.\r\n\r\n**Step 3**. You have the option to **choose a Display Name** that is different from your Username. The Username is what you use to log into your account. It is also part of the URL for your Crabgrass account. \r\n\r\nThe Display Name is shown next to the profile picture at the top of your account page.\r\n\r\n**Step 4**. You can choose to receive **email notifications** about changes of Crabgrass pages you watch. If you do you have the option to either reveive an email everytime something is changed or to receive an email that notifies you about all changes that were made in one day. \r\n\r\nNotifications by email can, however, be intercepted by others if they go via non-encrypted channels. Please read [**Securing your email**](../secure-communication#496) to learn more about how you can **improve your email security**.\r\n\r\n**Step 5**. Crabgrass lets you choose in which **language** the site is displayed for you. Be aware that your choice of language might give away information about you.\r\n\r\n**Step 6** In the User Preferences you can also **select your Time Zone**.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that settings such as language or time zone, or any kind information about yourself, allow others to get a better picture of who and possibly where you are. \r\n\r\n**Step 7** If you need to **change your password** enter a new password and confirm it.\r\n\r\nMake sure you click ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/crab21_savechanges.png) before you leave the page! Only if you have successfully saved the changes you will see this message:\r\n\r\n![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/crab22_changessaved.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 2: You have successfully updated your profile*\r\n"
