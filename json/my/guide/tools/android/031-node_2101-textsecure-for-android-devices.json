Your contact's phone will display a QR code and your phone will open **Barcode Scanner**.\r\n\r\n**Step 6:** Use **Barcode Scanner** on your phone to scan your contact's *QR code*.\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/049.png) ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/050.png) \r\n\r\n*Figure 13 & 14: Your contact's QR code / Barcode scanner*\r\n\r\n**Step 7:** Once the QR code has been successfully scanned **TextSecure** will check that the identity is valid.\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/051.png) \r\n\r\n*Figure 15: TextSecure identity verified*\r\n\r\n**Step 8:** Once you have verified your contact's **TextSecure** identity, they should repeat the above steps to verify yours.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"3.2\"></a>\r\n## 3.2 Export your messages\r\n\r\n**Note:** While **TextSecure** allows you to export your messages, the  messages in the backup file will **not** be encrypted and you should take additional steps to protect its contents.\r\n\r\n**Step 1:** Tap on ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/015.png) in the top right of the main **TextSecure** screen to bring up the menu and select ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/052.png).\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** The next screen will open on the *import* options, tap ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/053.png).\r\n\r\n**Step 3:** On the *export* screen tap ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/054.png).\r\n\r\n**Step 4:** Confirm that you want to export the unencrypted messages to the storage on your phone by tapping ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/053.png).\r\n\r\n**Step 5:** **TextSecure** will confirm the export has completed by displaying ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/055.png).  You will find a file called *Textsecure.xml* on your phone's storage that contains your **unencrypted** messages.\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/056.png) ![](/sbox/screen/textsecure-en-1/057.png) \r\n\r\n*Figure 16 & 17: TextSecure Export and Export confirmation screens*"
