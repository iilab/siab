The key difference between Android and other operating systems is that Android is, mostly, an Open Source (<a href=\"/en/Glossary#FOSS\"><em>FOSS</em></a>) system, which allows the operating system to be audited independently to verify if it properly protects users' information and communication. It also facilitates development of security applications for this platform. Many security-aware programmers develop Android applications with user safety and security in mind. Some of these will be highlighted later in this chapter.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless what type of smartphone you are using, there are issues that you should be aware of when you use a phone which connects to the internet and comes with features such as <a href=\"/en/glossary#GPS\"><em>GPS</em></a> or wireless networking capacities. In this chapter we focus on devices with the Android platform, because, as mentioned above, it's easier to secure data and communications. Nonetheless, basic setup guides and some applications for devices other than Android phones are provided, too.</p>\n\n<p>Blackberry phones have been presented as \u201csecure\u201d messaging and email devices. This is because messages and emails are securely channeled through Blackberry servers, out of the reach of potential eavesdroppers. Unfortunately, more and more governments are demanding access to these communications, citing need for guarding against potential terrorism and organised crime. India, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Lebanon are examples of governments which have scrutinized the use of Blackberry devices and demanded access to user data in their countries.</p>\n\n<h3>Feature Phones</h3>\n\n<p>Another category of mobiles are often called 'feature phones' (e.g.  Nokia 7705 Twist or Samsung Rogue). Recently, feature phones have increased their functionalities to include those of some smartphones. But generally, feature phones' operating systems are less accessible, therefore there are limited opportunities for security applications or improvements. We do not specifically address feature phones, although many measures discussed here make sense for feature phones too.</p>\n\n<h3>Branded and locked smartphones</h3>\n\n<p>Smartphones are usually sold branded or locked. Locking smartphones means that the device can only be operated with one carrier, whose SIM card is the only one that will work in the device. Mobile network operators usually brand a phone by installing their own firmware or software. They may also disable some functionalities or add others. Branding is a means for companies to increase revenue by channelling your smartphone use, often also collecting data about how you are using the phone or by enabling remote access to your smartphone.</p>\n\n<p>For these reasons, we recommend that you buy an unbranded smartphone if you can. A locked phone poses a higher risk since all your data is routed through one carrier, which centralises your data streams and makes it impossible to change SIM cards to disseminate the data over different carriers. If your phone is locked, ask someone you trust about unlocking it.</p>\n\n<h3>General Setup</h3>\n\n<p>Smartphones have many settings which control the security of the device. It is important to pay attention to how your smartphone is set up. In the Hands-on Guides below we will alert you to certain smartphone security settings that are available but not active by default, as well as those which are active by default and make your phone vulnerable.</p>\n\n<div class=\"getstarted\">\n\n<p>Hands-on: Get started with the <a href=\"/en/android_basic\"><em>Basic Android Set-up Guide</em></a></p>\n\n</div>\n\n<h3>Installing and updating applications</h3>\n\n<p>The usual way to install new software on your smartphone is to use the iPhone Appstore or Google Play store, log in with your user credentials, and download and install a desired application. By logging-in you associate your usage of the online store with the logged-in user account. The owners of the application store keep records of this user's browsing history and application choices.</p>\n\n<p>The applications which are offered in the official online store are, supposedly, verified by store owners (Google or Apple), but in reality this provides weak protection against what applications will do after being installed on your phone. For example, some applications may copy and send out your address book after you install them on your phone. On Android phones each application needs to request, during the installation process, what it will be permitted to do when it is in use. You should pay close attention to what permissions are requested, and if these permissions make sense for the function of the app you are installing. For example, if you are considering a \"news reader\" application and you find out that it requests the rights to send your contacts over a mobile data connection to a third party, you should look for alternative applications with appropriate access and rights.</p>\n\n<p>Android apps are also available from sources outside the official Google channels. You just need to check the <em>Unknown sources</em> box in your <em>Security settings</em> in order to use these download sites. Some users may want to consider these alternative sites to minimize online contact with Google. One of the alternative store is <a href=\"http://f-droid.org\"><strong>F-Droid</strong></a> ('Free Droid'), which only provides <a href=\"/en/glossary#FOSS\"><em>FOSS</em></a> applications. However please remember that you should trust the site before you download any apps from it. For inexperienced users we recommend that you use Google Play store.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to (or are unable to) go online to access apps, you can transfer apps from someone else's phone by sending <a href=\"/en/glossary#apk\"><em>.apk</em></a> files (short for 'android application package') via bluetooth.

Some smartphone tools can even extend some of this security beyond VoIP, to mobile phone calls as well (See <strong>Redphone</strong> below).</p>\n\n<p>Here we list a few tools and their pros and cons:</p>\n\n<h3>Skype</h3>\n\n<p>The most popular commercial VoIP application, <a href=\"/en/glossary#skype\"><em>Skype</em></a>, is available for all smartphone platforms and works well if your wireless connectivity is reliable. It is less reliable on mobile data connections.</p>\n\n<p>In the section <a href=\"/en/chapter_7_3\"><strong><em>Securing other internet communication tools</em></strong></a> of <a href=\"/en/chapter-7\"><strong><em>Chapter 7: How to keep your Internet communication private</em></strong></a>, we discussed the risks of using Skype, and why, if possible, it should be avoided. In summary, Skype is a non Open-Source software what makes it very difficult to independently confirm its level of security. Additionally, Skype is owned by Microsoft, which has a commercial interest in knowing when you use Skype and from where.

                        "value": "## Talking Securely ##\r\n\r\n### Basic telephony ###\r\n\r\nIn the section on\u00a0[***Basic functions, trackability and anonymity***](/en/chapter_10_2_2)\u00a0in [***Chapter 10: How to use mobile phones as securely as possible***](/en/chapter-10) we discussed different measures you should consider to lower the risk of interception when using the mobile phone operator network for your voice communication.\r\n\r\nUsing Internet through your smartphone over mobile data connections or WiFi can provide more secure ways to communicate with people, namely by using [*VoIP*](/en/Glossary#VoIP) and employing means to secure this channel of communication. Some smartphone tools can even extend some of this security beyond VoIP, to mobile phone calls as well (See **Redphone** below).\r\n\r\nHere we list a few tools and their pros and cons:\r\n\r\n### Skype ###\r\n\r\nThe most popular commercial VoIP application, [*Skype*](/en/glossary#skype), is available for all smartphone platforms and works well if your wireless connectivity is reliable. It is less reliable on mobile data connections.\r\n\r\nIn the section [***Securing other internet communication tools***](/en/chapter_7_3) of [***Chapter 7: How to keep your Internet communication private***](/en/chapter-7), we discussed the risks of using Skype, and why, if possible, it should be avoided. In summary, Skype is a non Open-Source software what makes it very difficult to independently confirm its level of security. Additionally, Skype is owned by Microsoft, which has a commercial interest in knowing when you use Skype and from where. Skype also may allow law enforcement agencies retrospective access to all your communications history.\r\n\r\n### Other VoIP ###\r\n\r\nUsing VoIP is generally free (or significantly cheaper than mobile phone calls) and leaves few data traces. In fact, a secured VoIP call can be the most secure way to communicate.\r\n\r\n[**CSipSimple**](http://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.csipsimple&fdpage=4) is a powerful VoIP client for Android phones that is well maintained and comes with many easy set-up wizards for different VoIP services.\r\n\r\n[**Open Secure Telephony Network (OSTN)**](https://guardianproject.info/wiki/OSTN) and the server provided by the Guardian project, [**ostel.co**](https://ostel.co), currently offers one of the most secure means to communicate via voice.

Downloading (and removing) emails from an email server and storing them only on your smartphone is not advised. You can set up your email application to use only copies of emails.\r\n\r\n- If you use email encryption with some of your contacts, consider installing it on your smartphone, too. The additional benefit is that encrypted emails will remain secret if the phone falls into wrong hands.\r\n\r\nStoring your private encryption key on your mobile device may seem risky. But the benefit of being able to send and store emails securely encrypted on the mobile device might outweigh the risks. Consider creating a mobile-only encrytpion key-pair (using [**APG**](/en/APG_main)) for your use on your smartphone, so you do not copy your encryption private key from your computer to the mobile device. Note that this requires that you ask people you communicate with to also encrypt emails using your mobile-only encryption key. \r\n\r\n<div class=getstarted markdown=1>\r\nHands-on: Get started with the [*K9 and APG Guide*](/en/K9_APG_main)\r\n</div>"

                        "safe_value": "<h2>Get full access to your smartphone</h2>\n\n<p>Most smartphones are capable of more than their installed operating system, manufacturers' software (firmware), or the mobile operators' programmes allow. Conversely, some functionalities are 'locked in' so the user is not capable of controlling or altering these functions, and they remain out of reach. In most cases those functionalities are unnecessary for smartphone users. There are however, some applications and functionalities that can enhance the security of data and communications on a smartphone. Also there are some other existing functionalities that can be removed to avoid security risks.</p>\n\n<p>For this, and other reasons, some smartphone users choose to manipulate the various software and programs running the smartphone in order to gain appropriate privileges to allow them to install enhanced functionalities, or remove or reduce other ones.</p>\n\n<p>The process of overcoming the limits imposed by mobile carriers, or manufacturers of operating systems on a smartphone is called rooting (in case of Android devices), or jailbreaking (in case of iOS devices, like iPhone or iPad). Typically, successful rooting or jailbreaking will result in your having all the privileges needed to install and use additional applications, make modifications to otherwise locked-down configurations, and total control over data storage and memory of the smartphone.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Rooting or jailbreaking may not be a reversible process, and it requires experience with software installation and configuration. Consider the following:</p>\n\n<ul><li>There is a risk of making your smartphone permanently inoperable, or 'bricking' it (i.e. turning it into a 'brick').</li>\n<li>The manufacturer or mobile carrier warranty may be voided.</li>\n<li>In some places, this process maybe illegal.</li>\n</ul><p>But if you are careful, a rooted device is a straightforward way to gain more control over your smartphone to make it much more secure.</p>\n\n<h3>Alternative Firmware</h3>\n\n<p>Firmware refers to programmes that are closely related to the particular device. They are in cooperation with the device's operating system and are responsible for basic operations of the hardware of your smartphone, such as the speaker, microphone, cameras, touchscreen, memory, keys, antennas, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If you have an Android device, you might consider installing a firmware alternative to further enhance your control of the phone. Note that in order to install alternative firmware, you need to root your phone.</p>\n\n<p>An example of an alternative firmware for an Android phone is <a href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.com\"><strong>Cyanogenmod</strong></a> which, for example, allows you to uninstall applications from the system level of your phone (i.e. those installed by the phone's manufacturer or your mobile network operator). By doing so, you can reduce the number of ways in which your device can be monitored, such as data that is sent to your service provider without your knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Cyanogenmod ships by default with an OpenVPN application, which can be tedious to install otherwise. VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of the ways to securely proxy your internet communication (see below).</p>\n\n<p>Cyanogenmod also offers an Incognito browsing mode in which history of your communication is not recorded on your smartphone.</p>\n\n<p>Cyanogenmod comes with many other features. However, it is not supported by all Android devices, so before proceeding, check out the <a href=\"http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices\">list of supported devices</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Encryption of whole volumes</h3>\n\n<p>If your phone is rooted you may consider encrypting it's entire data storage or creating a volume on the smartphone to protect some information on the phone.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nemesis2.luksmanager&amp;hl=en\"><strong>Luks Manager</strong></a> allows easy, on-the-fly strong encryption of volumes with an user-friendly interface. We highly recommend that you install this tool before you start storing important data on your Android device and use the Encrypted Volumes that the Luks Manager provides to store all your data.</p>\n\n<h3>Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h3>\n\n<p>A VPN provides an encrypted tunnel through the internet between your device and a VPN server. This is called a tunnel, because unlike other encrypted traffic, like https, it hides all services, protocols, and contents. A VPN connection is set up once, and only terminates when you decide.</p>\n\n<p>Note that since all your traffic goes through the proxy or VPN server, an intermediary only needs to have access to the proxy to analyze your activities. Therefore it is important to carefully choose amongst proxy services and VPN services. It is also advisable to use different proxies and/or VPNs since distributing your data streams reduces the impact of a compromised service.</p>\n\n<p>We recommend using the <a href=\"https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn\"><strong>RiseUp VPN</strong></a> server. You can use RiseUp VPN on Android device after installing Cyanogenmod (see above). It is also easy to setup connection to RiseUp VPN on the iPhone - read more <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1424\">here</a>.</p>\n",

Conversely, some functionalities are 'locked in' so the user is not capable of controlling or altering these functions, and they remain out of reach. In most cases those functionalities are unnecessary for smartphone users. There are however, some applications and functionalities that can enhance the security of data and communications on a smartphone. Also there are some other existing functionalities that can be removed to avoid security risks.\r\n\r\nFor this, and other reasons, some smartphone users choose to manipulate the various software and programs running the smartphone in order to gain appropriate privileges to allow them to install enhanced functionalities, or remove or reduce other ones.\r\n\r\nThe process of overcoming the limits imposed by mobile carriers, or manufacturers of operating systems on a smartphone is called rooting (in case of Android devices), or jailbreaking (in case of iOS devices, like iPhone or iPad). Typically, successful rooting or jailbreaking will result in your having all the privileges needed to install and use additional applications, make modifications to otherwise locked-down configurations, and total control over data storage and memory of the smartphone.\r\n\r\n**WARNING**: Rooting or jailbreaking may not be a reversible process, and it requires experience with software installation and configuration. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n- There is a risk of making your smartphone permanently inoperable, or 'bricking' it (i.e. turning it into a 'brick').\r\n- The manufacturer or mobile carrier warranty may be voided.\r\n- In some places, this process maybe illegal.\r\n\r\nBut if you are careful, a rooted device is a straightforward way to gain more control over your smartphone to make it much more secure.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Firmware ###\r\n\r\nFirmware refers to programmes that are closely related to the particular device. They are in cooperation with the device's operating system and are responsible for basic operations of the hardware of your smartphone, such as the speaker, microphone, cameras, touchscreen, memory, keys, antennas, etc.\r\n\r\nIf you have an Android device, you might consider installing a firmware alternative to further enhance your control of the phone. Note that in order to install alternative firmware, you need to root your phone.\r\n\r\nAn example of an alternative firmware for an Android phone is [**Cyanogenmod**](http://www.cyanogenmod.com) which, for example, allows you to uninstall applications from the system level of your phone (i.e. those installed by the phone's manufacturer or your mobile network operator). By doing so, you can reduce the number of ways in which your device can be monitored, such as data that is sent to your service provider without your knowledge. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Cyanogenmod ships by default with an OpenVPN application, which can be tedious to install otherwise. VPN (Virtual Private Network) is one of the ways to securely proxy your internet communication (see below). \r\n\r\nCyanogenmod also offers an Incognito browsing mode in which history of your communication is not recorded on your smartphone.\r\n\r\nCyanogenmod comes with many other features. However, it is not supported by all Android devices, so before proceeding, check out the [list of supported devices](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/devices).\r\n \r\n### Encryption of whole volumes ###\r\n\r\nIf your phone is rooted you may consider encrypting it's entire data storage or creating a volume on the smartphone to protect some information on the phone.\r\n\r\n[**Luks Manager**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nemesis2.luksmanager&hl=en) allows easy, on-the-fly strong encryption of volumes with an user-friendly interface. We highly recommend that you install this tool before you start storing important data on your Android device and use the Encrypted Volumes that the Luks Manager provides to store all your data.\r\n\r\n### Virtual Private Network (VPN) ###\r\n\r\nA VPN provides an encrypted tunnel through the internet between your device and a VPN server. This is called a tunnel, because unlike other encrypted traffic, like https, it hides all services, protocols, and contents. A VPN connection is set up once, and only terminates when you decide.\r\n\r\nNote that since all your traffic goes through the proxy or VPN server, an intermediary only needs to have access to the proxy to analyze your activities. Therefore it is important to carefully choose amongst proxy services and VPN services. It is also advisable to use different proxies and/or VPNs since distributing your data streams reduces the impact of a compromised service.\r\n\r\nWe recommend using the [**RiseUp VPN**](https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn) server. You can use RiseUp VPN on Android device after installing Cyanogenmod (see above). It is also easy to setup connection to RiseUp VPN on the iPhone - read more [here](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT1424)."
