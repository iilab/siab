Perhaps the biggest vulnerability this creates for users of these sites is the possibility of identity fraud, which is increasingly common. In addition, the more information about yourself you reveal online, the easier it becomes for the authorities to identify you and monitor your activities. The online activities of diaspora activists from some countries have led to the targeting of their family members by the authorities in their homelands.</p>\n\n<p>Ask yourself: is it necessary to post the following information online?</p>\n\n<ul><li>birth dates </li>\n<li>contact phone numbers</li>\n<li>addresses</li>\n<li>details of family members</li>\n<li>sexual orientation</li>\n<li>education and employment history</li>\n</ul><h2>Friends, followers and contacts</h2>\n\n<p>The first thing you will do after filling in your personal details with any social networking application is establish connections to other people. Presumably these contacts are people you know and trust \u2013 but you may also be connecting to an online community of like-minded individuals that you have never met. The most important thing to understand is what information you are allowing this online community to have.</p>\n\n<p>When using a social network account such as Facebook, where a lot of information about yourself is held, consider only connecting to people you know and trust not to misuse the information you post.</p>\n\n<h2>Status updates</h2>\n\n<p>On Twitter and Facebook and similar networks, the status update answers the questions: What am I doing right now? What's happening? The most important thing to understand about the status update is who can actually see it. The default setting for the status update on most social networking applications is that anyone on the internet can see it. If you only want your contacts to see the updates, you need to tell the social networking application to keep your updates hidden from everyone else.</p>\n\n<p>To do this in Twitter, look for \u201cProtect Your Tweets\u201d. In Facebook, change your settings to share your updates with \u201cFriends Only\u201d. Even if you switch to those settings, consider how easy it is for your information to be reposted by followers and friends. Agree with your network of friends on a common approach to passing on the information posted in your social networking accounts. You should also think about what you may be revealing about your friends that they may not want other people to know; it's important to be sensitive about this, and to ask others to be sensitive about what they reveal about you.</p>\n\n<p>There have been many incidents in which information included in status updates has been used against people. Teachers in the US have been fired after posting updates about how they felt about their students; other employees have lost their jobs for posting about their employers. This is something that nearly everyone needs to be careful about.</p>\n\n<h2>Sharing internet content</h2>\n\n<p>It's easy to share a link to a website and get your friend's attention. But who else will be paying attention, and what kind of reaction will they have? If you say you like a site which is in some way related to bringing down a repressive regime, that regime might take an interest and then target you.</p>\n\n<p>If you want your contacts to be the only people to see the things you share or mark as interesting, make sure you check your privacy settings.</p>\n\n<h2>Revealing your location</h2>\n\n<p>Most social networking sites will display your location if that data is available. This function is generally provided when you use a GPS-enabled phone to interact with a social network, but don't assume that it's not possible if you aren't connecting from a mobile. The network your computer is connected to may also provide location data. The way to be safest about it is to double-check your settings.</p>\n\n<p>Be particularly mindful of location settings on photo and video sharing sites. Don't just assume that they're not sharing your location: double-check your settings to be sure.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy\">On Locational Privacy, and How to Avoid Losing it Forever</a> from the Electronic Frontier Foundation website.</p>\n\n<h2>Sharing videos/photos</h2>\n\n<p>Photos and videos can reveal people's identities very easily. It's important that you have the consent of the subject/s of any photo or video that you post. If you are posting an image of someone else, be aware of how you may be compromising their privacy. Never post a video or photo of anyone without getting their consent first.</p>\n\n<p>Photos and videos can also reveal a lot of information unintentionally. Many cameras will embed hidden data (metadata tags), that reveal the date, time and location of the photo, camera type, etc. Photo and video sharing sites may publish this information when you upload content to their sites.</p>\n\n<h2>Instant chats</h2>\n\n<p>Many social networking sites have tools that allow you to have discussions with your friends in real time. These operate like Instant Messaging and are one of the most insecure ways to communicate on the internet, both because they may reveal who you are communicating with, and what you are communicating about.</p>\n\n<p><em>Connecting to the site via https is a minimum requirement for secure chatting, but even this is not always a guarantee that your chat is using a secure connection. For example, Facebook chat uses a different channel to HTTPS (and is more prone to exposure)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It is more secure to use a specific application for your chats, such as Pidgin with an Off-the-record plugin, which uses encryption. Read the 'Pidgin \u2013 secure instant messaging' hands-on guide.</p>\n\n<h2>Joining/creating groups, events and communities</h2>\n\n<p>What information are you giving to people if you join a group or community? What does it say about you? Alternatively, what are people announcing to the world if they join a group or community that you have created? How are you putting people at risk?</p>\n\n<p>When you join a community or group online it is revealing something about you to others. On the whole, people may assume that you support or agree with what the group is saying or doing, which could make you vulnerable if you are seen to align yourself with particular political groups, for example. Also if you join a group with a large number of members that you don't know, then this can compromise any privacy or security settings that you have applied to your account, so think about what information you are giving away before joining. Are you using your photo and real name so strangers can identify you?</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if you set up a group and people choose to join it, what are they announcing to the world by doing so? For example, perhaps it is a gay and lesbian support group that you have set up to help people, but by joining it people are openly identifying themselves as gay or gay-friendly, which could bring about dangers for them in the real world.</p>\n\n<div class=\"getstarted\">\n\n<p><strong>Hands-on: Get started with the</strong> <a href=\"/en/social_networking_tools\"><strong><em>Social networking tools: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others</em></strong></a></p>\n\n</div>\n",

                        "value": "Social networking sites ask you for a good deal of data about yourself to make it easier for other users to find and connect to you. Perhaps the biggest vulnerability this creates for users of these sites is the possibility of identity fraud, which is increasingly common. In addition, the more information about yourself you reveal online, the easier it becomes for the authorities to identify you and monitor your activities. The online activities of diaspora activists from some countries have led to the targeting of their family members by the authorities in their homelands.\r\n\r\nAsk yourself: is it necessary to post the following information online?\r\n\r\n- birth dates \r\n- contact phone numbers\r\n- addresses\r\n- details of family members\r\n- sexual orientation\r\n- education and employment history\r\n\r\n\r\n## Friends, followers and contacts ##\r\n\r\nThe first thing you will do after filling in your personal details with any social networking application is establish connections to other people. Presumably these contacts are people you know and trust \u2013 but you may also be connecting to an online community of like-minded individuals that you have never met. The most important thing to understand is what information you are allowing this online community to have.\r\n\r\nWhen using a social network account such as Facebook, where a lot of information about yourself is held, consider only connecting to people you know and trust not to misuse the information you post. \r\n\r\n## Status updates ##\r\n\r\nOn Twitter and Facebook and similar networks, the status update answers the questions: What am I doing right now? What's happening? The most important thing to understand about the status update is who can actually see it. The default setting for the status update on most social networking applications is that anyone on the internet can see it. If you only want your contacts to see the updates, you need to tell the social networking application to keep your updates hidden from everyone else. \r\n\r\nTo do this in Twitter, look for \u201cProtect Your Tweets\u201d. In Facebook, change your settings to share your updates with \u201cFriends Only\u201d. Even if you switch to those settings, consider how easy it is for your information to be reposted by followers and friends.
