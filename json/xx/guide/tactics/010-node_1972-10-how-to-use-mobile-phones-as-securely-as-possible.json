So if they know which phone number, OR phone id number, OR SIM card number belongs to you, they may be able to use their contacts to see your phone-use patterns.\r\n\r\nBorna: And I suppose they can listen in to my conversations even on my mobile phone then?\r\n\r\nDelir: In your case, and thanks to Uncle, your phone isn't registered to you, and the SIM card is also not connected to you in any way. So even if they track where the SIM card and the phone are they don't necessarily know you are connected to the SIM card, or to the phone. \r\n</div>\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\n* [10.2.1 Best practices for phone security](/en/node/1777)\r\n* [10.2.2 Basic functions, trackability and anonymity](/en/node/1778)\r\n* [10.2.3 Text based communications \u2013 SMS / Text messages](/en/node/1779)\r\n* [10.2.4 Functions beyond speech and messages](/en/node/1780)\r\n"

There are inexpensive techniques which third parties can use to intercept your written communications, or to listen to your calls, if they are in proximity to the phone and can receive transmissions from it. And of course, mobile phone providers have access to all your voice and text communications. It is currently expensive and/or somewhat technically cumbersome to encrypt phone calls so that even the mobile phone provider can't eavesdrop \u2013 however, these tools are expected to become cheaper soon. To deploy the encryption you would first have to install an encryption application on your phone, as well as on the device of the person with whom you plan to communicate. Then you would use this application to send and receive encrypted calls and/or messages. Encryption software is currently only supported on a few models of so-called 'smart' phones.</p>\n\n<p>Conversations between Skype and mobile phones are not encrypted either, since at some point, the signal will move to the mobile network, where encryption is NOT in place.</p>\n",

Some phones can be switched on remotely and brought into action in this way, even when they look as though they are switched off. \r\n\r\n* Never let people whom you don't trust get physical access to your phone; this is a common way of installing spying software on your phone.\r\n\r\n* If you are conducting private and important meetings, switch your phone off and disconnect the battery. Or don't carry the phone with you if you can leave it where it will be absolutely safe. \r\n\r\n* Make sure that any person with whom you communicate also employs the safeguards described here.\r\n\r\n* In addition, don't forget that using a phone in public, or in places that you don't trust, makes you vulnerable to traditional eavesdropping techniques, or to having your phone stolen.\r\n\r\n**About interception of calls**\r\n\r\nTypically, encryption of voice communications (and of text messages) that travel through the mobile phone network is relatively weak. There are inexpensive techniques which third parties can use to intercept your written communications, or to listen to your calls, if they are in proximity to the phone and can receive transmissions from it. And of course, mobile phone providers have access to all your voice and text communications. It is currently expensive and/or somewhat technically cumbersome to encrypt phone calls so that even the mobile phone provider can't eavesdrop \u2013 however, these tools are expected to become cheaper soon. To deploy the encryption you would first have to install an encryption application on your phone, as well as on the device of the person with whom you plan to communicate. Then you would use this application to send and receive encrypted calls and/or messages. Encryption software is currently only supported on a few models of so-called 'smart' phones.\r\n\r\nConversations between Skype and mobile phones are not encrypted either, since at some point, the signal will move to the mobile network, where encryption is NOT in place. \r\n"

Also you should find out exactly what the capabilities of your phone are, in order to be certain that you have taken appropriate measures:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Do not store confidential files and photos on your mobile phone. Move them, as soon as you can, to a safe location, as discussed in <a href=\"/en/chapter-4\"><strong><em>Chapter 4: How to Protect Files on Your Computer</em></strong></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Frequently erase your phone call records, messages, address book entries, photos, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you use your phone to browse the internet, follow safe practices similar to those you use when you are on the computer (e.g. always send information over encrypted connection like <a href=\"/en/glossary#SSL\">HTTPS</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free. See <a href=\"/en/chapter-1\"><strong><em>Chapter 1: How to Protect Your Computer From Malware and Hackers</em></strong></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do not accept and install unknown and unverified programmes on your phone, including ring tones, wallpaper, <a href=\"/en/glossary#Java\">java applications</a> or any others that originate from an unwanted and unexpected source. They may contain viruses, malicious software or spying programmes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Observe your phone's behaviour and functioning. Look out for unknown programmes and running processes, strange messages and unstable operation. If you don't know or use some of the features and applications on your phone, disable or uninstall them if you can.</p></li>\n<li><p>Be wary when connecting to WiFi access points that don't provide passwords, just as you would when using your computer and connecting to WiFi access points.

                        "value": "Mobile phones are turning into mobile computing devices, complete with their own operating systems and downloadable applications that provide various services to the user. \r\n\r\n[***Chapter 11: How to use smartphones as securely as possible***](/en/chapter-11) covers issues related to these kinds of mobile devices, as connectivity to internet brings about both potentials as well as risks we have covered in previous chapters.\r\n\r\n\u2028While some of the earlier mobile phone models have fewer or no internet functions, it is nevertheless important to observe the precautions outlined below on all phones. Also you should find out exactly what the capabilities of your phone are, in order to be certain that you have taken appropriate measures:\r\n\r\n* Do not store confidential files and photos on your mobile phone. Move them, as soon as you can, to a safe location, as discussed in [***Chapter 4: How to Protect Files on Your Computer***](/en/chapter-4).\r\n\r\n* Frequently erase your phone call records, messages, address book entries, photos, etc.\r\n\r\n* If you use your phone to browse the internet, follow safe practices similar to those you use when you are on the computer (e.g. always send information over encrypted connection like [HTTPS](/en/glossary#SSL)).\r\n\r\n* Connect your phone to a computer only if you are sure it is malware free. See [***Chapter 1: How to Protect Your Computer From Malware and Hackers***](/en/chapter-1).\r\n\r\n* Do not accept and install unknown and unverified programmes on your phone, including ring tones, wallpaper, [java applications](/en/glossary#Java) or any others that originate from an unwanted and unexpected source. They may contain viruses, malicious software or spying programmes.\r\n\r\n* Observe your phone's behaviour and functioning. Look out for unknown programmes and running processes, strange messages and unstable operation. If you don't know or use some of the features and applications on your phone, disable or uninstall them if you can.\r\n\r\n* Be wary when connecting to WiFi access points that don't provide passwords, just as you would when using your computer and connecting to WiFi access points. The mobile phone is essentially like a computer and thus shares the vulnerabilities and insecurities that affect computers and the internet.\r\n\r\n* Make sure communication channels like [Infrared (IrDA)](/en/glossary#IrDA), [Bluetooth](/en/glossary#Bluetooth) and Wireless Internet (WiFi) on your phone are switched off and disabled if you are not using them. Switch them on only when they are required. Use them only in trusted situations and locations. Consider not using Bluetooth, as it is relatively easy to eavesdrop on this form of communication. Instead, transfer data using a cable connection from the phone to handsfree headphones or to a computer."
