It is also the last program to handle outgoing information.\nLike a security guard, posted at the door of a building to decide who can enter and who can leave, a firewall receives, inspects\nand makes decisions about all incoming and outgoing data. Naturally, it\nis critical that you defend yourself against untrusted connections from\nthe Internet and from local networks, either of which could give\nhackers and viruses a clear path to your computer. In fact, though, monitoring\noutgoing connections originating from your own computer is no less important.</p>\n\n<p>A good firewall allows you to choose access permissions for each\nprogram on your computer. When one of these programs tries to contact\nthe outside world, your firewall will block the attempt and give you a\nwarning unless it recognizes the program and verifies that you have given\nit permission to make that sort of connection. This is largely to\nprevent existing <a href=\"/en/glossary#Malware\"><em>malware</em></a>from spreading viruses or inviting hackers\ninto your computer. In this regard, a firewall provides both a\nsecond line of defense and an early-warning system that might help you\nrecognize when your computer's security is being threatened.</p>\n\n<h3>Firewall software</h3>\n\n<p>Recent versions of Microsoft Windows include a built-in firewall, which is now turned on automatically. Unfortunately, the Windows firewall is limited in many ways, for example, it does not examine outgoing connections. However, there is an excellent <a href=\"/en/glossary#Freeware\"><em>freeware</em></a> program called <a href=\"/en/glossary#Comodo_Firewall\"><em>Comodo Personal Firewall</em></a>, which does a better job of keeping your computer secure.</p>\n\n<div class=\"getstarted\">\n\n<p>Hands-on: Get started with the <a href=\"/en/comodofirewall_main\"><strong><em>Comodo Firewall Guide</em></strong></a></p>\n\n</div>\n\n<h3>Preventing untrusted network connections</h3>\n\n<ul><li>Only install essential programs on the computer you use for\nsensitive work, and make sure you get them from a reputable source. Uninstall any software that you do not use. </li>\n<li>Disconnect your computer from the Internet when you are not using it and shut it down completely overnight </li>\n<li>Do not share your Windows password with anyone. </li>\n<li>If you have enabled any 'Windows services' that you are no longer using, you should disable them. See the <a href=\"/en/chapter_1_5\"><strong><em>Further reading</em></strong></a> section for more about this</li>\n<li>Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a firewall installed </li>\n<li>If you do not already have one, you should consider installing an additional firewall to protect the entire local network at your office. Many commercial broadband <a href=\"/en/glossary#Router\"><em>gateways</em></a> include an easy-to-use firewall, and turning it on can make your network much more secure. If you are not sure where to start with this, you might want to ask for assistance from whoever helped set up your network</li>\n</ul><div class=\"background\">\n\n<p>Asani: So, now you want me to install anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software? Can my computer cope with all that?</p>\n\n<p>Muhindo: Absolutely. In fact, these three tools are the bare minimum\nif you want to stay secure on the Internet these days. They're made to\nwork together, so installing them all shouldn't cause any problems.\nRemember, though, you don't want want to run two anti-virus programs or\ntwo firewalls at the same time.</p>\n\n</div>\n",

                        "value": "A firewall is the first program on a computer that sees incoming data from the\r\nInternet. It is also the last program to handle outgoing information.\r\nLike a security guard, posted at the door of a building to decide who can enter and who can leave, a firewall receives, inspects\r\nand makes decisions about all incoming and outgoing data. Naturally, it\r\nis critical that you defend yourself against untrusted connections from\r\nthe Internet and from local networks, either of which could give\r\nhackers and viruses a clear path to your computer. In fact, though, monitoring\r\noutgoing connections originating from your own computer is no less important.\r\n\r\nA good firewall allows you to choose access permissions for each\r\nprogram on your computer. When one of these programs tries to contact\r\nthe outside world, your firewall will block the attempt and give you a\r\nwarning unless it recognizes the program and verifies that you have given\r\nit permission to make that sort of connection. This is largely to\r\nprevent existing [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware)from spreading viruses or inviting hackers\r\ninto your computer. In this regard, a firewall provides both a\r\nsecond line of defense and an early-warning system that might help you\r\nrecognize when your computer's security is being threatened. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Firewall software ###\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent versions of Microsoft Windows include a built-in firewall, which is now turned on automatically. Unfortunately, the Windows firewall is limited in many ways, for example, it does not examine outgoing connections. However, there is an excellent [*freeware*](/en/glossary#Freeware) program called [*Comodo Personal Firewall*](/en/glossary#Comodo_Firewall), which does a better job of keeping your computer secure.\r\n\r\n<div class=getstarted markdown=1> Hands-on: Get started with the [***Comodo Firewall Guide***](/en/comodofirewall_main)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Preventing untrusted network connections ###\r\n- Only install essential programs on the computer you use for\r\nsensitive work, and make sure you get them from a reputable source. Uninstall any software that you do not use. \r\n- Disconnect your computer from the Internet when you are not using it and shut it down completely overnight \r\n- Do not share your Windows password with anyone. \r\n- If you have enabled any 'Windows services' that you are no longer using, you should disable them. See the [***Further reading***](/en/chapter_1_5) section for more about this\r\n- Make sure that all of the computers on your office network have a firewall installed </li>\r\n- If you do not already have one, you should consider installing an additional firewall to protect the entire local network at your office. Many commercial broadband [*gateways*](/en/glossary#Router) include an easy-to-use firewall, and turning it on can make your network much more secure. If you are not sure where to start with this, you might want to ask for assistance from whoever helped set up your network\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=background markdown=1>\r\nAsani: So, now you want me to install anti-virus, anti-spyware and firewall software? Can my computer cope with all that?\r\n\r\nMuhindo: Absolutely. In fact, these three tools are the bare minimum\r\nif you want to stay secure on the Internet these days. They're made to\r\nwork together, so installing them all shouldn't cause any problems.\r\nRemember, though, you don't want want to run two anti-virus programs or\r\ntwo firewalls at the same time.\r\n</div>"
