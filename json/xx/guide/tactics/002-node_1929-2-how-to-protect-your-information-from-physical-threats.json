It would be a mistake\nto assume that this is the only such threat to the security of your\ninformation, but it would be even more shortsighted to ignore it.\nThere are a number of steps you can take to help reduce the risk of\nphysical intrusion. The categories and suggestions below, many of which\nmay apply to your home as well as your office, represent a foundation upon which you should build in accordance with your own particular physical security situation.</p>\n\n<h3>Around the office</h3>\n\n<ul><li><p>Get to know your neighbours. Depending on the security climate\nin your country and in your neighbourhood, one of two things may be\npossible. Either you can turn them into allies who will help you keep\nan eye on your office, or you can add them to the list of potential\nthreats that your security plan must address.</p></li>\n<li><p>Review how you protect all of the doors, windows and other points of entry that lead into your office.</p></li>\n<li><p>Consider installing a surveillance camera or a motion-sensor alarm.</p></li>\n<li><p>Try to create a reception area, where visitors can be met\nbefore they enter the office, and a meeting room that is separate from\nyour normal work space.</p></li>\n</ul><h3>In the office</h3>\n\n<ul><li><p>Protect network cables by running them inside the office.</p></li>\n<li><p>Lock network devices such as <a href=\"/en/glossary#Server\"><em>servers</em></a>, <a href=\"/en/glossary#Router\"><em>routers</em></a>, <a href=\"/en/glossary#Router\"><em>switches</em></a>, <a href=\"/en/glossary#Router\">hubs</a>\nand modems into secure rooms or cabinets. An intruder with physical\naccess to such equipment can install <a href=\"/en/glossary#Malware\"><em>malware</em></a> capable of stealing data\nin transit or attacking other computers on your network even after he\nleaves. In some circumstances it may be beneficial to hide servers, computers or other equipment in attics, over a fake ceiling, or even with a neighbor, and use them through wireless connection.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you have a wireless network, it is critical that you\nsecure your <a href=\"/en/glossary#Router\"><em>access point</em></a> so that intruders cannot join your network\nor monitor your traffic. If you are using an insecure wireless network, anyone in your neighbourhood with a laptop becomes a potential intruder. This is an unusual definition of 'physical', but it helps to consider that a malicious individual who can monitor your wireless network has the same access as one who can sneak into your office and connect an ethernet cable. The steps required\nto secure a wireless network will vary, depending on your <a href=\"/en/glossary#Router\"><em>access point</em></a> hardware and software, but they are rarely difficult to follow.</p></li>\n</ul><h3>At your work</h3>\n\n<ul><li><p>You should position your computer screen carefully, both on\nyour desk and when you are away from the office, in order to prevent\nothers from reading what is displayed there. In the office, this means\nconsidering the location of windows, open doors and the guest waiting\narea, if you have one.</p></li>\n<li><p>Most desktop computer cases have a slot where you can attach\na padlock that will prevent anyone without a key from getting inside.\nIf you have cases like this in the office, you should lock them so that\nintruders cannot tamper with their internal hardware. You might also\nconsider this feature when purchasing new computers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use a locking <a href=\"/en/glossary#Security_cable\"><em>security cable</em></a>, where possible, to prevent\nintruders from stealing the computers themselves. This is especially\nimportant for laptops and small desktops that could be hidden inside a\nbag or under a coat.</p></li>\n</ul><h3>Software and settings related to physical security</h3>\n\n<ul><li>Make sure that, when you restart your computer, it asks you for a\npassword before allowing you to run software and access files. If it\ndoes not, you can enable this feature in Windows by clicking on the <em>Start</em> menu, selecting the Control Panel, and double-clicking on User Accounts. In the User Accounts screen, select your own account and click Create a Password. Choose a secure password, as discussed in <a href=\"/en/chapter-3\"><strong><em>Chapter 3: How to create and maintain good passwords</em></strong></a>, enter your password, confirm it, click Create Password and click Yes, Make Private. </li>\n<li>There are a few settings in your computer's <a href=\"/en/glossary#BIOS\"><em>BIOS</em></a> that are relevant to physical security. First, you should configure\nyour computer so that it will not <em><a href=\"/en/glossary#Booting\">boot</a></em> from the USB device, CD-ROM\nor DVD drives. Second, you should set a password on the <a href=\"/en/glossary#BIOS\"><em>BIOS</em></a> itself, so that an\nintruder can not simply undo the previous setting.

                        "value": "Malicious individuals seeking access to your sensitive information\r\nrepresent one important class of [*physical threat*](/en/glossary#Physical_threat). It would be a mistake\r\nto assume that this is the only such threat to the security of your\r\ninformation, but it would be even more shortsighted to ignore it.\r\nThere are a number of steps you can take to help reduce the risk of\r\nphysical intrusion. The categories and suggestions below, many of which\r\nmay apply to your home as well as your office, represent a foundation upon which you should build in accordance with your own particular physical security situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Around the office ###\r\n\r\n- Get to know your neighbours. Depending on the security climate\r\n\tin your country and in your neighbourhood, one of two things may be\r\n\tpossible. Either you can turn them into allies who will help you keep\r\n\tan eye on your office, or you can add them to the list of potential\r\n\tthreats that your security plan must address.\r\n\t\r\n- Review how you protect all of the doors, windows and other points of entry that lead into your office.\r\n\t\r\n- Consider installing a surveillance camera or a motion-sensor alarm.\r\n\t\r\n- Try to create a reception area, where visitors can be met\r\n\tbefore they enter the office, and a meeting room that is separate from\r\n\tyour normal work space.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n### In the office ###\r\n\r\n- Protect network cables by running them inside the office.\r\n\t\r\n- Lock network devices such as [*servers*](/en/glossary#Server), [*routers*](/en/glossary#Router), [*switches*](/en/glossary#Router), [hubs](/en/glossary#Router)\r\n\tand modems into secure rooms or cabinets. An intruder with physical\r\n\taccess to such equipment can install [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware) capable of stealing data\r\n\tin transit or attacking other computers on your network even after he\r\n\tleaves. In some circumstances it may be beneficial to hide servers, computers or other equipment in attics, over a fake ceiling, or even with a neighbor, and use them through wireless connection.\r\n\t\r\n- If you have a wireless network, it is critical that you\r\n\tsecure your [*access point*](/en/glossary#Router) so that intruders cannot join your network\r\n\tor monitor your traffic. If you are using an insecure wireless network, anyone in your neighbourhood with a laptop becomes a potential intruder. This is an unusual definition of 'physical', but it helps to consider that a malicious individual who can monitor your wireless network has the same access as one who can sneak into your office and connect an ethernet cable. The steps required\r\n\tto secure a wireless network will vary, depending on your [*access point*](/en/glossary#Router) hardware and software, but they are rarely difficult to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n### At your work ###\r\n\r\n- You should position your computer screen carefully, both on\r\n\tyour desk and when you are away from the office, in order to prevent\r\n\tothers from reading what is displayed there. In the office, this means\r\n\tconsidering the location of windows, open doors and the guest waiting\r\n\tarea, if you have one.\r\n\t\r\n- Most desktop computer cases have a slot where you can attach\r\n\ta padlock that will prevent anyone without a key from getting inside.\r\n\tIf you have cases like this in the office, you should lock them so that\r\n\tintruders cannot tamper with their internal hardware. You might also\r\n\tconsider this feature when purchasing new computers.\r\n\t\r\n- Use a locking [*security cable*](/en/glossary#Security_cable), where possible, to prevent\r\n\tintruders from stealing the computers themselves. This is especially\r\n\timportant for laptops and small desktops that could be hidden inside a\r\n\tbag or under a coat.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n### Software and settings related to physical security ###\r\n\r\n- Make sure that, when you restart your computer, it asks you for a\r\n\tpassword before allowing you to run software and access files. If it\r\n\tdoes not, you can enable this feature in Windows by clicking on the *Start* menu, selecting the Control Panel, and double-clicking on User Accounts. In the User Accounts screen, select your own account and click Create a Password. Choose a secure password, as discussed in [***Chapter 3: How to create and maintain good passwords***](/en/chapter-3), enter your password, confirm it, click Create Password and click Yes, Make Private. \r\n- There are a few settings in your computer's [*BIOS*](/en/glossary#BIOS) that are relevant to physical security. First, you should configure\r\n\tyour computer so that it will not *[boot](/en/glossary#Booting)* from the USB device, CD-ROM\r\n\tor DVD drives. Second, you should set a password on the [*BIOS*](/en/glossary#BIOS) itself, so that an\r\n\tintruder can not simply undo the previous setting. Again, be sure to choose a secure\r\n\tpassword.\r\n- If you rely on a secure password database, as discussed in [***Chapter 3***](/en/chapter-3), to store your Windows or [*BIOS*](/en/glossary#BIOS) passwords for a particular computer, make sure that you do not keep your only copy of the database on that computer.\r\n- Get in the habit of locking your account whenever you step away from your computer. On Windows, you can do this quickly by holding down the Windows logo key and pressing the L key. This will only work if you have created a password for your account, as described above. \r\n- [*Encrypt*](/en/glossary#Encryption) sensitive information on\r\n\tcomputers and storage devices in your office. See [***Chapter\r\n\t4: How to protect the sensitive files on your computer***](/en/chapter-4) for\r\n\tadditional details and pointers to the appropriate Hands-on Guides.#\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=background markdown=1>\r\nRudo: I'm a bit nervous about messing around in BIOS. Can I break my computer if I do something wrong?\r\n\r\ntto: You sure can, at least for a little while.
