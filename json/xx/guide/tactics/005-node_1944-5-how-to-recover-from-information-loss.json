Then, there are important documents on the computers you use, which may be in the office or at home. There are address books, chat histories and personal program settings. It is also possible that some information is stored on removable media as well, including USB memory sticks, portable hard drives, CDs, DVDs, and old floppy disks.

Obviously, this distinction does not apply to files of which you have only one copy, but it is extremely important for certain types of information. One common disaster scenario occurs when only duplicates of an important document are backed up, and the master copy itself gets lost or destroyed before those duplicates can be updated. Imagine, for example, that you have been travelling for a week while updating the copy of a particular spreadsheet that you keep on your USB memory stick.

Essentially, you need to make sure that each data type is stored in at least two separate locations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Electronic documents</strong> - Create a full backup of the documents on your computer using a program like <a href=\"/en/glossary#Cobian_Backup\"><em>Cobian Backup</em></a>, which is described in more detail below. Store the backup on something portable so that you can take it home or to some other safe location. External hard drives, CD/DVDs or USB memory sticks are possible choices. Some people use CDs or DVDs for this, since the risk of overwriting and losing your backup is lower. Blank CDs may be cheap enough to allow you to use a new one every time you make a backup.</p>\n\n<p>Because this category of data often contains the most sensitive information, it is particularly important that you protect your electronic document backups using encryption. You can learn how to do this in <a href=\"/en/chapter-4\"><strong><em>Chapter 4: How to protect the sensitive files on your computer</em></strong></a> and in the <a href=\"/en/truecrypt_main\"><strong><em>TrueCrypt Guide</em></strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Program databases</strong> - Once you have determined the location of your program databases, you can back them up in the same way as electronic documents.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Email</strong> - Rather than accessing your email only through a web browser, install an email client like <a href=\"/en/glossary#Thunderbird\"><em>Thunderbird</em></a> and configure it to work with your account. The <a href=\"/en/thunderbird_main\"><strong><em>Thunderbird Guide</em></strong></a> explains in detail how to do this. Also most webmail services will provide instructions on how to use such programs and, often, how to import your email addresses into them. You can learn more about this in the Further Reading section, below. If you choose to move your old email messages to your computer so they are not stored on the server (e.g. for security reasons), make sure that you include them in the backup of electronic documents described above.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mobile phone contents</strong> - To back up the phone numbers and text messages on your mobile phone, you can connect it to your computer using the appropriate software, which is generally available from the website of the company that manufactured your phone. You may need to buy a special USB cable to do this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Printed documents</strong> - Where possible, you should scan all of your important papers, then back them up along with your other electronic documents, as discussed above.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, you should have rearranged your storage devices, data types and backups in a way that makes your information much more resistant to disaster:</p>\n\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\"><tr><th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\n<th>Storage Device</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n\n</tr><tr><td>Electronic documents</td>\n<td>Master</td>\n<td>Computer hard drive</td>\n<td>Office\n</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Electronic documents</td>\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>CDs</td>\n<td>Home\n</td>\n</tr><tr><td>A few important electronic documents</td>\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>USB memory stick</td>\n<td>With me\n</td>\n</tr></table><table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\"><tr><th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\n<th>Storage Device</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n\n</tr><tr><td>Program databases</td>\n<td>Master</td>\n<td>Computer hard drive</td>\n<td>Office\n</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Program databases</td>\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>CDs</td>\n<td>Home\n</td>\n</tr></table><table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\"><tr><th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\n<th>Storage Device</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n\n</tr><tr><td>Email &amp; email contacts</td>\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>Gmail account</td>\n<td>Internet\n</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Email &amp; email contacts</td>\n<td>Master</td>\n<td>Thunderbird on office computer</td>\n<td>Office\n</td>\n</tr></table><table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\"><tr><th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\n<th>Storage Device</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n\n</tr><tr><td>Text messages &amp; mobile phone contacts</td>\n<td>Master</td>\n<td>Mobile phone</td>\n<td>With me\n</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Text messages &amp; mobile phone contacts</td>\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>Computer hard drive</td>\n<td>Office\n</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Text messages &amp; mobile phone contacts</td>\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>Backup SIM</td>\n<td>Home\n</td>\n</tr></table><table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\"><tr><th>Data Type</th>\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\n<th>Storage Device</th>\n<th>Location</th>\n\n</tr><tr><td>Printed documents</td>\n<td>Master</td>\n<td>Desk drawer</td>\n<td>Office\n</td>\n</tr><tr><td>Scanned documents</td>\n<td>Duplicate</td>\n<td>CDs</td>\n<td>At home\n</td>\n</tr></table><div class=\"background\">\n\n<p>Elena: I know some people who keep all of their important documents on Gmail, by attaching them to 'draft' messages or emails to themselves. Would that count as a 'second physical location' for my files?</p>\n\n<p>Nikolai: It might help you recover if you lose one or two very important documents, but it's pretty awkward. Honestly, how many documents per week would you be willing to back up like that? Plus, you need to consider whether or not those attachments are safe, especially if you're at all worried about your email being monitored. Unless you're connecting to Gmail securely, this is a bit like handing over your sensitive information on a silver platter.

                        "value": "To back up all of the data types listed above, you will need a combination of software and process solutions. Essentially, you need to make sure that each data type is stored in at least two separate locations.\r\n\r\n**Electronic documents** - Create a full backup of the documents on your computer using a program like [*Cobian Backup*](/en/glossary#Cobian_Backup), which is described in more detail below. Store the backup on something portable so that you can take it home or to some other safe location. External hard drives, CD/DVDs or USB memory sticks are possible choices. Some people use CDs or DVDs for this, since the risk of overwriting and losing your backup is lower. Blank CDs may be cheap enough to allow you to use a new one every time you make a backup.\r\n\r\nBecause this category of data often contains the most sensitive information, it is particularly important that you protect your electronic document backups using encryption. You can learn how to do this in [***Chapter 4: How to protect the sensitive files on your computer***](/en/chapter-4) and in the [***TrueCrypt Guide***](/en/truecrypt_main).\r\n\r\n**Program databases** - Once you have determined the location of your program databases, you can back them up in the same way as electronic documents.\r\n\r\n**Email** - Rather than accessing your email only through a web browser, install an email client like [*Thunderbird*](/en/glossary#Thunderbird) and configure it to work with your account. The [***Thunderbird Guide***](/en/thunderbird_main) explains in detail how to do this. Also most webmail services will provide instructions on how to use such programs and, often, how to import your email addresses into them. You can learn more about this in the Further Reading section, below. If you choose to move your old email messages to your computer so they are not stored on the server (e.g. for security reasons), make sure that you include them in the backup of electronic documents described above.\r\n\r\n**Mobile phone contents** - To back up the phone numbers and text messages on your mobile phone, you can connect it to your computer using the appropriate software, which is generally available from the website of the company that manufactured your phone. You may need to buy a special USB cable to do this.\r\n\r\n**Printed documents** - Where possible, you should scan all of your important papers, then back them up along with your other electronic documents, as discussed above.\r\n\r\nIn the end, you should have rearranged your storage devices, data types and backups in a way that makes your information much more resistant to disaster:\r\n\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Data Type</th>\r\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\r\n<th>Storage Device</th>\r\n<th>Location</th>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Electronic documents</td>\r\n<td>Master</td>\r\n<td>Computer hard drive</td>\r\n<td>Office\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Electronic documents</td>\r\n<td>Duplicate</td>\r\n<td>CDs</td>\r\n<td>Home\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>A few important electronic documents</td>\r\n<td>Duplicate</td>\r\n<td>USB memory stick</td>\r\n<td>With me\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Data Type</th>\r\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\r\n<th>Storage Device</th>\r\n<th>Location</th>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Program databases</td>\r\n<td>Master</td>\r\n<td>Computer hard drive</td>\r\n<td>Office\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Program databases</td>\r\n<td>Duplicate</td>\r\n<td>CDs</td>\r\n<td>Home\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Data Type</th>\r\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\r\n<th>Storage Device</th>\r\n<th>Location</th>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Email &amp; email contacts</td>\r\n<td>Duplicate</td>\r\n<td>Gmail account</td>\r\n<td>Internet\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Email &amp; email contacts</td>\r\n<td>Master</td>\r\n<td>Thunderbird on office computer</td>\r\n<td>Office\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Data Type</th>\r\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\r\n<th>Storage Device</th>\r\n<th>Location</th>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Text messages &amp; mobile phone contacts</td>\r\n<td>Master</td>\r\n<td>Mobile phone</td>\r\n<td>With me\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Text messages &amp; mobile phone contacts</td>\r\n<td>Duplicate</td>\r\n<td>Computer hard drive</td>\r\n<td>Office\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Text messages &amp; mobile phone contacts</td>\r\n<td>Duplicate</td>\r\n<td>Backup SIM</td>\r\n<td>Home\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Data Type</th>\r\n<th>Master/Duplicate</th>\r\n<th>Storage Device</th>\r\n<th>Location</th>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Printed documents</td>\r\n<td>Master</td>\r\n<td>Desk drawer</td>\r\n<td>Office\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>Scanned documents</td>\r\n<td>Duplicate</td>\r\n<td>CDs</td>\r\n<td>At home\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"background\" markdown=\"1\">\r\n\r\nElena: I know some people who keep all of their important documents on Gmail, by attaching them to 'draft' messages or emails to themselves. Would that count as a 'second physical location' for my files?\r\n\r\nNikolai: It might help you recover if you lose one or two very important documents, but it's pretty awkward. Honestly, how many documents per week would you be willing to back up like that? Plus, you need to consider whether or not those attachments are safe, especially if you're at all worried about your email being monitored. Unless you're connecting to Gmail securely, this is a bit like handing over your sensitive information on a silver platter. Using an HTTPS connection to Gmail in order to back up small Truecrypt volumes or KeePass database files would be pretty safe, because they're encrypted, but I really wouldn't recommend this as a general-purpose backup strategy.\r\n</div>\r\n"

This term is somewhat ambiguous, but generally refers to files that you keep track of yourself and that you open manually, either by double-clicking on them or by using a particular application's File menu. Specifically, it includes text files, word processing documents, presentations, PDFs and spreadsheets, among other examples. Unlike email messages, for example, electronic documents are generally not synchronised with remote copies over the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>When backing up your electronic documents, you should remember to back up your program databases, as well. If you use a calendar application or an electronic address book, for example, you will need to find the folder in which these programs store their data. Hopefully, these databases will be in the same location as your electronic documents, as they are often kept inside your <strong>My Documents</strong> folder on a Windows computer. If that is not the case, however, you should add the appropriate folders to your regular backup.</p>\n\n<p>Email stored by an application such as <a href=\"/en/glossary#Thunderbird\"><em>Thunderbird</em></a> is a special example of a program database. If you use an email program, especially if you are unable or unwilling to store a copy of your messages on the server, then you must ensure that this email database is included in your regular backup. You may consider image and video files to be electronic documents or items within a program database, depending on how you interact with them. Applications like Windows Media player and iTunes, for example, work like databases. If you use programs like this, you might have to search your hard drive to learn where they store the actual media files that they help manage.</p>\n\n<h3>Storage devices</h3>\n\n<p>Before you can back up your electronic documents, you must decide what kind of storage device you will use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>USB disk or memory sticks</strong> - USB disk or memory sticks can be quite inexpensive, and offer large capacity. They are easy to erase or overwrite numerous times. USB disk or memory sticks have a limited lifetime, which greatly depends on ways and frequency of usage but is generally estimated to be around 10 years.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compact Discs (CDs)</strong> CDs store around 700 Megabytes (MB) of data. You will need a <a href=\"/en/glossary#CD_burner\"><em>CD burner</em></a> and blank discs in order to create a CD backup. If you want to erase a CD and update the files stored on it, you will need to have a CD-RW burner and rewritable CDs. All major operating systems, including Windows XP, now include built-in software that can write CDs and CD-RWs. Keep in mind that the information written on these discs may begin to deteriorate after five or ten years. If you need to store a backup for longer than that, you will have to recreate the CDs occasionally, buy special 'long life' discs or use a different backup method.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Digital Video Discs (DVDs)</strong> - DVDs store up to 4.7 Gigabytes (GB) of data. They work much like CDs but require slightly more expensive equipment. You will need a DVD or <a href=\"/en/glossary#CD_burner\"><em>DVD-RW burner</em></a>, and appropriate discs. As with a CD, the data written on a normal DVD will eventually begin to fade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Remote server</strong> - A well-maintained network backup server may have almost unlimited capacity, but the speed and stability of your own Internet connection will determine whether or not this is a realistic option. Keep in mind that running a backup server in your own office, while faster than copying information over the Internet, violates the requirement that you keep a copy of your important data in two different physical locations. \nThere are free storage services on the Internet, as well, but you should very carefully consider the risks of putting your information online and you should always encrypt your backups before uploading them to servers run by organisations or individuals whom you do not know and trust.
