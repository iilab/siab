Then, you\nmust save that password database.</p>\n\n<p>To create a new password database, follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. <strong>Select File &gt; New</strong> as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/11.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 4: The KeePass screen with File &gt; New selected</em></p>\n\n<p>This will activate the <em>Create New Password Database</em> screen as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/12.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 5: The KeePass Create New Password Database screen</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. <strong>Type</strong> in the master password you have created into the <em>Master Password</em> field.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/13.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 6: The KeePass Set Composite Master Key screen with the Master Password field completed</em></p>\n\n<p>You will see an orange-green progress bar underneath the password\nentry. As you type in a password and the number of characters increases, the amount of green in the bar will increase to show the complexity and strength of your password improving.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>:  You should aim to have at least half the bar filled with green when you have finished typing in your password.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png\" alt=\"\" /> to activate the <em>Repeat Master Password</em> screen and confirm the password as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/15.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 7: The KeePass Repeat Master Password screen</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. <strong>Type</strong> in the same password as before, then <strong>click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/16.png\" alt=\"\" /> to see if you are typing in your password correctly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Do not carry out step 5 if you fear that someone may be looking over your shoulder.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have successfully typed in the master password twice, the <strong>KeePass</strong> console is activated as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/17.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 8: The KeePass Password Safe screen in active mode</em></p>\n\n<p>After you have created the password database, you need to save it.

It will come in very handy when you are creating a backup of it.</p>\n\n<p>Congratulations! You have successfully created and saved your secure\npassword database. Now you can begin to fill it up with all your\ncurrent and future passwords.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"2.2\" id=\"2.2\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>2.2. How to Add an Entry</h2>\n\n<p>The <em>Add Entry</em> screen lets you add account information, passwords and other important details into your newly-created database. In the example that follows, you will be adding entries to store passwords and user names for different websites and email accounts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. <strong>Select Edit &gt; Add Entry</strong> in the <strong>KeePass</strong> <em>Password Safe</em> screen to activate the <em>Add Entry</em> screen as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/21.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 11: The KeePass Password Safe screen with Edit &gt; Add Entry selected</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/22.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 12: The KeePass Add Entry screen</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <em>Add Entry</em> screen presents you with a number of fields to be completed. None of these fields are mandatory; information submitted here is largely for your own convenience. It may prove useful in situations where you are searching for a particular entry.</p>\n\n<p>A brief explanation of these different text boxes is presented as follows:</p>\n\n<ul><li><p><strong>Group</strong>: <strong>KeePass</strong> lets you sort your passwords into pre-defined groups. For example: <em>'Internet'</em> would be a good place to store passwords that relate to website accounts.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Title</strong>: A name to describe the particular password entry. For example: Gmail password</p></li>\n<li><strong>User name</strong>: The user name associated with the password entry. For example: securitybox@gmail.com</li>\n<li><strong>URL</strong>: The internet site associated with the password entry. For example: https://mail.google.com</li>\n<li><strong>Password</strong>: This feature automatically generates a random password when the <em>Add Entry</em> screen is activated. If you are registering a new email account, you can use the 'default' password in this field. You can also use this feature if you want to change an existing password for one generated by <strong>KeePass</strong>. Since <strong>KeePass</strong> will always remember it for you, there is no need to even see the password. A randomly generated password is considered strong (that is, difficult for an intruder to guess or break).</li>\n</ul><p>Generating a random password on request will be described in the\nfollowing section. You can, of course, replace the default password\nwith one of your own. For instance, if you are creating an entry for an\naccount that already exists you will want to enter the correct password\nhere.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Repeat Password</strong>: The confirmation of the password.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality</strong>: A progress bar that measures password strength according to length and randomness. The more green there is on the scale, the stronger your chosen password.</li>\n<li><strong>Notes</strong>: Here is where you type in descriptive or general information about the account or site for which you are storing information. For example: <em>Mail server settings: POP3 SSL, pop.gmail.com, Port 995; SMTP TLS, smtp.gmail.com, Port: 465</em></li>\n</ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: Creating or modifying the password entries in <strong>KeePass</strong> does not change your actual passwords! Think of <strong>KeePass</strong> as a secure electronic address book for your passwords. It only stores what you write in it, nothing more.</p>\n\n<p>If you select <em>Internet</em> from the <em>Group</em> drop-down list, your password entry might resemble the following:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/24.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 13: The KeePass Add Entry screen - completed</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png\" alt=\"\" /> to save your changes to the <em>Add Entry</em> screen.</p>\n\n<p><em>Your password entry now appears in the</em> Internet <em>group.</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/25.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 14: The KeePass Password Safe screen</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The bottom panel of this window displays information about the entry selected. This includes creation, editing and expiry time as well as notes you may have recorded in the entry. It does not reveal the password.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Expires</strong>: Check this item to activate text boxes in which you can specify an expiry date. By doing this, you could add a reminder for yourself to change the password at a specific time (every 3 months,  for example). When a password has expired, it will appear with a red cross next to its name, as shown in the example below:</li>\n</ul><p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/23.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 15: An example of an expired key in the NetSecureDb</em>.<em>kdb</em> <em>screen</em></p>\n\n<p><a name=\"2.3\" id=\"2.3\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>2.3 How to Edit an Entry</h2>\n\n<p>You may edit an existing entry in <strong>KeePass</strong> at any time. You can change your password or modify other details stored in the password entry. It is generally considered good security practice to change a password every three to six months (remembering to update it on your email system etc. before changing it in KeePass).</p>\n\n<p>To edit an entry, perform the following steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. <strong>Select</strong> the correct <em>Group</em> in the left-hand side to activate the entries associated with it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. <strong>Select</strong> the relevant entry, then <strong>right click</strong> on that selected entry to activate the following window:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/26.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 16: The KeePass Password Safe screen displaying the Edit menu</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png\" alt=\"\" /> to save any necessary changes to this information, including the password.</p>\n\n<p>To change an existing password (that you previously created yourself)\nfor one generated and recommended by <strong>KeePass</strong>, please read the following section.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"2.4\" id=\"2.4\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>2.4 How to Generate Random Passwords</h2>\n\n<p>Long, random passwords are considered strong in the world of\nsecurity. Their randomness is based on mathematical principles and\ncannot simply be 'guessed' by someone who is trying to break into one\nof your accounts. <strong>KeePass</strong> supplies a  <em>Password Generator</em>,\nto help you with this process. As you have seen above, a random\npassword is automatically generated when you add a new entry.\nThis section will describe how to generate one yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <em>Password Generator</em> can be activated from within the <em>Add Entry</em> and <em>Edit/View Entry</em> screens. Alternatively, <strong>select: Tools &gt; Password Generator</strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/27.png\" alt=\"\" /> from within either the <em>Add Entry</em> or <em>Edit/View Entry</em> screen, to activate the <em>Password Generator</em> screen as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/28.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 17: The KeePass Password Generator screen</em></p>\n\n<p>The <em>Password Generator</em> screen presents a variety of choices for generating a password. You can specify the length of the desired\npassword, the pool of characters from which it will be created and much\nelse. For our purposes, we can use the default options presented. This\nmeans that the generated password will be 20 characters long and made\nup of lower and upper case letters, as well as numbers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/29.png\" alt=\"\" /> to begin the process. When complete, <strong>KeePass</strong> will present the generated password to you.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/30.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 18: The KeePass Generated Password section</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can view the generated password by <strong>clicking</strong> \n<img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/16.png\" alt=\"\" />. However, this creates a security risk as we discussed above. In essence, you will never need to see the generated password. We will explain more about this in section <a href=\"/en/keepass_passwords\"><strong>3.0 Using KeePass Passwords</strong></a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/31.png\" alt=\"\" /> to accept the password and return to the <em>Add Entry</em> screen as follows:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/24.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 19: The KeePass Add Entry screen</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png\" alt=\"\" /> to save this entry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. <strong>Select File &gt; Save</strong> to save your updated password database.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"2.5\" id=\"2.5\"></a></p>\n\n<h2>2.5 How to Exit, Minimise and Restore KeePass</h2>\n\n<p>You can minimise or exit the <strong>KeePass</strong> program at any time.

Then, you\r\nmust save that password database.\r\n\r\nTo create a new password database, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Select File > New** as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/11.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 4: The KeePass screen with File > New selected*\r\n\r\nThis will activate the *Create New Password Database* screen as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/12.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 5: The KeePass Create New Password Database screen*\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Type** in the master password you have created into the *Master Password* field.\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/13.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 6: The KeePass Set Composite Master Key screen with the Master Password field completed*\r\n\r\nYou will see an orange-green progress bar underneath the password\r\nentry. As you type in a password and the number of characters increases, the amount of green in the bar will increase to show the complexity and strength of your password improving. \r\n\r\n**Tip**:  You should aim to have at least half the bar filled with green when you have finished typing in your password. \r\n\r\n**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png) to activate the *Repeat Master Password* screen and confirm the password as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/15.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 7: The KeePass Repeat Master Password screen*\r\n\r\n**Step 4**. **Type** in the same password as before, then **click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png)\r\n\r\n**Step 5**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/16.png) to see if you are typing in your password correctly.\r\n\r\n**Warning**: Do not carry out step 5 if you fear that someone may be looking over your shoulder. \r\n\r\nOnce you have successfully typed in the master password twice, the **KeePass** console is activated as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/17.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 8: The KeePass Password Safe screen in active mode*\r\n\r\nAfter you have created the password database, you need to save it. To save the password database, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Select File > Save As** as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/18.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 9: The KeePass Password Safe screen*\r\n\r\n*This will activate the Save As screen as follows*:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/19.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 10: The Save As screen*\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Type** in a name for your new password database file.\r\n\r\n**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/20.png) to save your database.\r\n\r\n**Tip**: Remember the location and file name of your database! It will come in very handy when you are creating a backup of it. \r\n\r\nCongratulations! You have successfully created and saved your secure\r\npassword database. Now you can begin to fill it up with all your\r\ncurrent and future passwords.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"2.2\"></a>\r\n## 2.2. How to Add an Entry ##\r\n\r\nThe *Add Entry* screen lets you add account information, passwords and other important details into your newly-created database. In the example that follows, you will be adding entries to store passwords and user names for different websites and email accounts. \r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Select Edit > Add Entry** in the **KeePass** *Password Safe* screen to activate the *Add Entry* screen as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/21.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 11: The KeePass Password Safe screen with Edit > Add Entry selected*\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/22.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 12: The KeePass Add Entry screen*\r\n\r\n**Note**: The *Add Entry* screen presents you with a number of fields to be completed. None of these fields are mandatory; information submitted here is largely for your own convenience. It may prove useful in situations where you are searching for a particular entry. \r\n\r\nA brief explanation of these different text boxes is presented as follows:\r\n\r\n- **Group**: **KeePass** lets you sort your passwords into pre-defined groups. For example: *'Internet'* would be a good place to store passwords that relate to website accounts.\r\n\r\n- **Title**: A name to describe the particular password entry. For example: Gmail password\r\n- **User name**: The user name associated with the password entry. For example: securitybox@gmail.com\r\n- **URL**: The internet site associated with the password entry. For example: https://mail.google.com\r\n- **Password**: This feature automatically generates a random password when the *Add Entry* screen is activated. If you are registering a new email account, you can use the 'default' password in this field. You can also use this feature if you want to change an existing password for one generated by **KeePass**. Since **KeePass** will always remember it for you, there is no need to even see the password. A randomly generated password is considered strong (that is, difficult for an intruder to guess or break).\r\n\r\nGenerating a random password on request will be described in the\r\nfollowing section. You can, of course, replace the default password\r\nwith one of your own. For instance, if you are creating an entry for an\r\naccount that already exists you will want to enter the correct password\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n- **Repeat Password**: The confirmation of the password.\r\n- **Quality**: A progress bar that measures password strength according to length and randomness. The more green there is on the scale, the stronger your chosen password.\r\n- **Notes**: Here is where you type in descriptive or general information about the account or site for which you are storing information. For example: *Mail server settings: POP3 SSL, pop.gmail.com, Port 995; SMTP TLS, smtp.gmail.com, Port: 465*\r\n\r\n**Note**: Creating or modifying the password entries in **KeePass** does not change your actual passwords! Think of **KeePass** as a secure electronic address book for your passwords. It only stores what you write in it, nothing more.\r\n\r\nIf you select *Internet* from the *Group* drop-down list, your password entry might resemble the following:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/24.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 13: The KeePass Add Entry screen - completed*\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png) to save your changes to the *Add Entry* screen.\r\n\r\n*Your password entry now appears in the* Internet *group.* \r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/25.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 14: The KeePass Password Safe screen*\r\n\r\n**Note**: The bottom panel of this window displays information about the entry selected. This includes creation, editing and expiry time as well as notes you may have recorded in the entry. It does not reveal the password.\r\n\r\n- **Expires**: Check this item to activate text boxes in which you can specify an expiry date. By doing this, you could add a reminder for yourself to change the password at a specific time (every 3 months,\tfor example). When a password has expired, it will appear with a red cross next to its name, as shown in the example below:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/23.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 15: An example of an expired key in the NetSecureDb*.*kdb* *screen*\r\n\r\n<a name=\"2.3\"></a>\r\n## 2.3 How to Edit an Entry ##\r\n\r\nYou may edit an existing entry in **KeePass** at any time. You can change your password or modify other details stored in the password entry. It is generally considered good security practice to change a password every three to six months (remembering to update it on your email system etc. before changing it in KeePass).\r\n\r\nTo edit an entry, perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Select** the correct *Group* in the left-hand side to activate the entries associated with it.\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Select** the relevant entry, then **right click** on that selected entry to activate the following window: \r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/26.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 16: The KeePass Password Safe screen displaying the Edit menu*\r\n\r\n**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png) to save any necessary changes to this information, including the password.\r\n\r\nTo change an existing password (that you previously created yourself)\r\nfor one generated and recommended by **KeePass**, please read the following section.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"2.4\"></a>\r\n## 2.4 How to Generate Random Passwords ##\r\n\r\nLong, random passwords are considered strong in the world of\r\nsecurity. Their randomness is based on mathematical principles and\r\ncannot simply be 'guessed' by someone who is trying to break into one\r\nof your accounts. **KeePass** supplies a  *Password Generator*,\r\nto help you with this process. As you have seen above, a random\r\npassword is automatically generated when you add a new entry.\r\nThis section will describe how to generate one yourself.\r\n\r\n**Note**: The *Password Generator* can be activated from within the *Add Entry* and *Edit/View Entry* screens. Alternatively, **select: Tools &gt; Password Generator**.\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/27.png) from within either the *Add Entry* or *Edit/View Entry* screen, to activate the *Password Generator* screen as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/28.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 17: The KeePass Password Generator screen*\r\n\r\nThe *Password Generator* screen presents a variety of choices for generating a password. You can specify the length of the desired\r\npassword, the pool of characters from which it will be created and much\r\nelse. For our purposes, we can use the default options presented. This\r\nmeans that the generated password will be 20 characters long and made\r\nup of lower and upper case letters, as well as numbers.\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/29.png) to begin the process. When complete, **KeePass** will present the generated password to you.\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/30.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 18: The KeePass Generated Password section*\r\n\r\n**Note**: You can view the generated password by **clicking** \r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/16.png). However, this creates a security risk as we discussed above. In essence, you will never need to see the generated password. We will explain more about this in section [**3.0 Using KeePass Passwords**](/en/keepass_passwords).\r\n\r\n**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/31.png) to accept the password and return to the *Add Entry* screen as follows:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/24.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 19: The KeePass Add Entry screen*\r\n\r\n**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/14.png) to save this entry.\r\n\r\n**Step 5**. **Select File > Save** to save your updated password database.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"2.5\"></a>\r\n## 2.5 How to Exit, Minimise and Restore KeePass ##\r\n\r\nYou can minimise or exit the **KeePass** program at any time. When you open or restore it again, you will be prompted to enter your *Master Password*. \r\n\r\n**KeePass** minimises itself, appearing in your system tray (at the bottom right corner of the screen) as follows: \r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/39.png).\r\n\r\n**KeePass** also lets you lock the program by performing the following steps:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Select File > Lock Workspace** to activate the following screen:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/40.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 20: The KeePass - Safe Before Close/Lock prompt screen*\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/43.png) to save your information and disable the **KeePass** console so it resembles *figure 3*, and the following icon will appear in your *System Tray*:\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/42.png)\r\n\r\nTo restore **KeePass** perform the following step:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Double click** this icon to restore **KeePass** to its normal size, and activate the following screen:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/33.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 21: The KeePass Open Database - NetSecureDb.kdb screen*\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Enter** your *Master Password* to open **KeePass**\r\n\r\nTo close **KeePass** perform the following step:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Select File > Exit** to close the **KeePass** program completely. \r\n\r\nIf you have any unsaved changes in the database, **KeePass** will prompt you to save them.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"2.6\"></a>\r\n## 2.6 How to Create a Backup of the Password Database file ##\r\n\r\nThe **KeePass** database file on your computer is denoted by its .kdb file\r\nextension. You can copy this file to a USB memory stick. No one else\r\nwill be able to open the database without the master password.\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Select File > Save As** from the main screen, and save a copy of the database to another location.\r\n\r\nYou can run the entire **KeePass program** from a USB memory stick.

Go to the related account or site and **paste** the password into the appropriate field:\r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/keepass-en-1/38.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 2: A Gmail Account displaying a pasted password*\r\n\r\n**Tip**: For efficient copying, pasting and switching windows, use the keyboard shortcuts. **Press and hold** the *Ctrl* key, then press *C* to copy a password. **Press and hold** the *Ctrl* key, then press *V* to paste that password. **Press and hold** the *Alt* key, then **press** the *tab* key to switch between open programs and windows.\r\n\r\n**Note**: By using **KeePass** all the time, you never actually have to see or know what your password is. The copy/paste functions take care of moving it from the database to the required window. If you use the *Random Generator* feature and then transfer this password to a new email account registration process, you will be using a password that you have never seen in plain view. And it still works!\r\n"
