It may take a little experience over time to determine which requests are legitimate, and which are threats.</p>\n\n<p>A firewall is simply a set of rules for monitoring inbound and outbound traffic. Every time you click <em>Allow</em> or <em>Block</em> <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> generates a rule for that process or program network connection request. <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> does this for both new or unrecognised processes and programs while permitting those listed in the <em>Trusted Software Vendors</em> list, in the <em>Firewall -&gt; Security settings -&gt; File Rating</em> window.</p>\n\n<p>Every time <strong>Comodo Firewall</strong> receives a connection request from a new or unrecognised processes and programs, it activates a pop-up <em>Firewall Alert</em> prompting you to either <em>Allow</em> or <em>Block</em> access to your system to and from the Internet. To help you become more familiar with firewall alerts and how to use them, the example below shows the firewall has blocked <strong>Firefox</strong> from running with a <em>Firewall Alert</em> resembling the following:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/28.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 5: An example of a COMODO Firewall Alert</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Remember my answer</strong>: This option is used to record whether you allowed or blocked a certain program from accessing <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong>. It will automatically allow or block connection requests from this program the next time it attempts to connect to your computer, based on whatever choice you have specified here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: We strongly recommend disabling the <em>Remember my answer option</em> when you first start using <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong>. Decide whether to allow or block different connection requests, and then observe how or if your decision affects your system operation. Enable the <em>Remember my answer</em> option if and <em>only</em> if you are completely sure of your decision.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Being strict about limiting access to you system is the best approach to computer security. Do not hesitate to block any suspicious or unidentifiable requests. If this causes a normal program to stop functioning correctly, you can allow the process to run next time you receive a firewall alert.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/30.png\" alt=\"\" /> to activate the <em>Process Activities List</em> to learn more about the process or program requesting access, as shown in the following screen:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/29.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 6: The firefox.exe Process Activities List</em></p>\n\n<p>If you have either determined a request is unsafe, or are simply uncertain about it, based on the information displayed in the <em>Process Activities List</em>,  <strong>click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/31.png\" alt=\"\" /> to direct <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> to deny access to your system.</p>\n\n<p>If you have determined that a legitimate program is making a non-malicious request, based on the information displayed in the program <em>Process Activities List</em> screen, then <strong>click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/32.png\" alt=\"\" /> to allow it access to your system.</p>\n\n<p>Given that <strong>Firefox</strong> is a safe program, <strong>check</strong> the <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/33.png\" alt=\"\" /> option so that <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> will allow <strong>Firefox</strong> to automatically access your system the next time.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, programs can be be added to the <em>Allow</em> or <em>Block</em> list by clicking <em>Tasks</em> from the main user interface and selecting <em>Firewall Tasks</em> as shown below.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/35.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 7: Firewall Tasks - Allow Application</em></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/34.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 8: Select and add firefox.exe to the Allow Application List</em></p>\n\n<p>Your ability to make the correct allow or block decisions will improve as you become more confident and experienced in using <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong>.</p>\n",

The drop down menu allows you choose among the following options:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Block All</strong>: This mode stops all Internet-related traffic and overrides any firewall configurations and rules you have specified. It will neither generate traffic rules for applications, nor record or 'learn' their behaviours.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Custom Ruleset</strong>: This mode applies <em>only</em> the user-defined <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> security policies and network traffic policies that you have previously defined in the <em>Security Settings &gt; Firewall &gt; Ruleset</em> and the <em>Defense+ &gt; HIPS &gt; HIPS Ruleset</em> windows.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safe Mode</strong>: This mode is the default setting for the <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> installations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tip</strong>: <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> maintains an internal list of commonly used applications and files verified as safe, and does not issue pop-up alerts for them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Both the <em>Training Mode</em> and disabling the firewall by unticking the <em>Enable Traffic Filtering</em> options are not recommended as they may compromise the effectiveness of <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> and expose your system to the risk of infection.</p>\n\n<p><a name=\"4.2\" id=\"4.2\"></a></p>\n\n<h3>4.2 The Defense+ Settings window</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: The features and options described in this section require a profound understanding of firewalls and related security issues, and is designed largely with the <strong>Advanced</strong> user in mind.</p>\n\n<p>The HIPS and Sandbox components of the <strong>COMODO Firewall</strong> are enabled by default during the installation process. Both features are grouped under the advanced settings menu as <em>Defense+</em></p>\n\n<p>Any computer connected to a network is technically speaking, a host computer. The <em>Defense+</em> components constantly monitor the activities of all executable files currently residing on your computer. An executable file is simply an application or program, or a part if it, and typically but not exclusively, is identified by the following file extensions: <em>.bat</em>, <em>.exe</em>, <em>.dll</em>, <em>.sys</em>, and others.</p>\n\n<p><em>Defense+</em> components issue pop-up warnings every time an unknown executable file attempts to run, and prompts you to either allow or block its functioning. It may prove important in situations where any type of maleware will attempt to install applications or programs to damage or steal your personal information, reformat your hard disk or hijack your computer, and use it to propagate malware or spam - without your consent or knowledge.</p>\n\n<h3>4.2.1 The Defense+ Settings - HIPS</h3>\n\n<p>To change the behaviour settings of HIPS perform the following steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> <em>HIPS</em> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/46.png\" alt=\"\" /> to activiate the screen below</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/40.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 5: HIPS Behavior Settings</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. <strong>Click</strong> on the drop down menu to select a security level mode and <strong>click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-47.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>The <em>HIPS</em> security levels resemble the <em>Firewall Behavior</em> security levels which offers similar options, and lets you choose the optimal level of host intrusion protection for your system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Paranoid Mode</strong>: This mode is the highest available level of security, and monitors all and any executable files apart from those you have specified as safe, including those on the <em>Trusted Software Vendor</em> list. It generates the greatest number of security alerts, and system activity is filtered through your configuration settings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Safe Mode</strong>: This mode will automatically 'learn' the behaviours of different application executables, while monitoring critical system activity. Every uncertified application will generate a <em>Security Alert</em> whenever it runs. This mode is the most widely recommended for the majority of users.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Clean PC Mode</strong>: This mode learns the activities of the applications currently installed on the computer while all new executables introduced to the system are monitored and controlled.</p>\n\n<p>By unticking the <em>Enable HIPS</em>, you can manually disable the host intrusion prevention system. This option is generally not recommended.</p>\n\n<h3>4.2.2 The Defense+ Settings - Sandbox</h3>\n\n<p>The <strong>Sandbox</strong> component provides a fully functional sandbox called the 'Virtual Desktop'. This is an isolated operating environment for running unknown, untrusted and suspicious applications. Applications executed inside the sandbox/virtual desktop will not affect other processes, programs or data on your real computer. In addition to running suspicious applications inside the sandbox on an ad-hoc basis, you can create a specific list of programs that should always run in the sandbox.</p>\n\n<p>Advanced settings for this powerful feature can be configured by <strong>clicking</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/48.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/41.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><em>Figure 6: The Defense+ Sandbox Advanced settings</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>Experienced</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> users are strongly encouraged to <strong>click</strong> <img src=\"/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/49.png\" alt=\"\" /> and <strong>select</strong> <em>Online Help</em> to access the extensive <strong>COMODO</strong> online help concerning <em>HIPS Settings</em> and <em>Sandbox Settings</em>.

It will neither generate traffic rules for applications, nor record or 'learn' their behaviours.\r\n\r\n**Custom Ruleset**: This mode applies *only* the user-defined **COMODO Firewall** security policies and network traffic policies that you have previously defined in the *Security Settings > Firewall > Ruleset* and the *Defense+ > HIPS > HIPS Ruleset* windows. \r\n\r\n**Safe Mode**: This mode is the default setting for the **COMODO Firewall** installations. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Tip**: **COMODO Firewall** maintains an internal list of commonly used applications and files verified as safe, and does not issue pop-up alerts for them.  \r\n\r\n**Warning**: Both the *Training Mode* and disabling the firewall by unticking the *Enable Traffic Filtering* options are not recommended as they may compromise the effectiveness of **COMODO Firewall** and expose your system to the risk of infection. \r\n\r\n<a name=\"4.2\"></a>\r\n### 4.2 The Defense+ Settings window ###\r\n\r\n**Note**: The features and options described in this section require a profound understanding of firewalls and related security issues, and is designed largely with the **Advanced** user in mind.\r\n\r\nThe HIPS and Sandbox components of the **COMODO Firewall** are enabled by default during the installation process. Both features are grouped under the advanced settings menu as *Defense+* \r\n\r\nAny computer connected to a network is technically speaking, a host computer. The *Defense+* components constantly monitor the activities of all executable files currently residing on your computer. An executable file is simply an application or program, or a part if it, and typically but not exclusively, is identified by the following file extensions: *.bat*, *.exe*, *.dll*, *.sys*, and others. \r\n\r\n*Defense+* components issue pop-up warnings every time an unknown executable file attempts to run, and prompts you to either allow or block its functioning. It may prove important in situations where any type of maleware will attempt to install applications or programs to damage or steal your personal information, reformat your hard disk or hijack your computer, and use it to propagate malware or spam - without your consent or knowledge.\r\n\r\n### 4.2.1 The Defense+ Settings - HIPS ###\r\n\r\nTo change the behaviour settings of HIPS perform the following steps:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**. **Click** *HIPS* ![](/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/46.png) to activiate the screen below \r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/40.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 5: HIPS Behavior Settings*\r\n\r\n**Step 2**. **Click** on the drop down menu to select a security level mode and **click** ![](/sbox/screen/comodo-en-47.png) \r\n\r\nThe *HIPS* security levels resemble the *Firewall Behavior* security levels which offers similar options, and lets you choose the optimal level of host intrusion protection for your system. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Paranoid Mode**: This mode is the highest available level of security, and monitors all and any executable files apart from those you have specified as safe, including those on the *Trusted Software Vendor* list. It generates the greatest number of security alerts, and system activity is filtered through your configuration settings.  \r\n\r\n**Safe Mode**: This mode will automatically 'learn' the behaviours of different application executables, while monitoring critical system activity. Every uncertified application will generate a *Security Alert* whenever it runs. This mode is the most widely recommended for the majority of users. \r\n\r\n**Clean PC Mode**: This mode learns the activities of the applications currently installed on the computer while all new executables introduced to the system are monitored and controlled. \r\n\r\n\r\nBy unticking the *Enable HIPS*, you can manually disable the host intrusion prevention system. This option is generally not recommended.\r\n\r\n  \r\n### 4.2.2 The Defense+ Settings - Sandbox ###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe **Sandbox** component provides a fully functional sandbox called the 'Virtual Desktop'. This is an isolated operating environment for running unknown, untrusted and suspicious applications. Applications executed inside the sandbox/virtual desktop will not affect other processes, programs or data on your real computer. In addition to running suspicious applications inside the sandbox on an ad-hoc basis, you can create a specific list of programs that should always run in the sandbox.\r\n\r\nAdvanced settings for this powerful feature can be configured by **clicking** ![](/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/48.png) \r\n\r\n![](/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/41.png)\r\n\r\n*Figure 6: The Defense+ Sandbox Advanced settings*\r\n\r\n**Note**: **Experienced** and **Advanced** users are strongly encouraged to **click** ![](/sbox/screen/comodo-en-1/49.png) and **select** *Online Help* to access the extensive **COMODO** online help concerning *HIPS Settings* and *Sandbox Settings*. Alternatively, you can refer to **https://help.comodo.com/topic-72-1-623-7587-Introduction-to-Comodo-Internet-Security.html** to choose from a list of online help topics.\r\n"
