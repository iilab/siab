time commitment between now and April 1st. If I understand correctly,

  - If Book -> 4/5 sections.

...short-term production workflow or the...

  Git -> HTML

  - Transifex. Transifex Live (Back and forth Markdown/JSON -> Transifex). Decide on Live (Drupal/Markdown)
  - Prose. 
    - Preview in Context.
    - Assembly/In Context. Flat (TOC)
    - Media.
    - Add a subsection.


Links
  - There is link checking.

Aliases : 
  - How to generate.
Redirects : 
  - URL redirects.

# TODO
