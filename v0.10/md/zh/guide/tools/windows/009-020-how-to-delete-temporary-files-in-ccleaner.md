## 3.0 How to Delete Temporary Files ##

In this section, we will learn how to delete all the temporary files
created by **Microsoft Windows** and most applications that you use on your computer.

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/13.png) or **select  Start > Programs > CCleaner** to activate the **CCleaner** console. 

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/18.png) to activate the following screen:

*Figure 1: The CCleaner console displaying the Cleaner pane*

The *Cleaner* window is divided into two panes, the left pane displaying the *Windows* and *Application* tabs, and the right pane featuring an empty space to display information or results from a given cleaning operation. The *Analyze* and *Run Cleaner* buttons are located beneath that space.

**Note**: By using the following steps, you will delete temporary files for the items you have checked in both the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs. Given that different users have different programs installed on their computer, your own list of applications may vary somewhat from the example in *Figure 2* above.

**Step 3**. **Scroll** down the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs and **check** all the options in the *Advanced* section too. As you check some of the options, a warning confirmation dialog box appears, explaining what each option will affect:

**Warning**: By checking the *Wipe Free Space* option, you will significantly increase the amount of time required for the cleaning process; as such, ensure you have at least an hour or more for this. 

**Note**: **Check** all the options in the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs to enable a full and thorough cleaning of the temporary files. However, it is essential that you understand what kind of configurations and settings are being deleted. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/22.png) to close each message and continue with the temporary file deletion process.

**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/23.png) to generate and view a list of the different temporary files available for deletion.

**Tip**: Close all other programs before you begin the cleaning process. If you leave them open, **CCleaner** may not remove all the temporary files associated with those programs, and you may receive pop-up notices resembling *Figure 4* below.

*Figure 5: An example of a list of temporary files for deletion*

**Note**: **CCleaner** only deletes the temporary files generated whenever you use an application – and *not* the application itself. In *Figure 5* for example, the *Applications – Office 2003* program suite remains installed on the computer, but its temporary files have been deleted. However, to use **CCleaner** to uninstall a program, please refer to [**Advanced Options, FAQ and Review**](/en/ccleaner_faq), section **5.1 How to Uninstall Programs Using CCleaner**.

**Step 6**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/27.png) activate the following screen:

**Step 7**. **Click** ![](/sbox/screen/ccleaner-en-1/22.png) to delete these temporary files as follows; after the deletion has been completed, the results displayed may resemble the following screen:

You have now successfully deleted your temporary files from both the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs using **CCleaner**.
