title: Storing Information on your Smartphone

---

Smartphones come with large data storage capacities. Unfortunately, the data stored on your device can be easily accessible by third parties, either remotely or with physical access to the phone. Some basic precautions to reduce inappropriate access to this information are explained in the [***Basic Set-Up Guide for Android***](/en/android_basic). Additionally, you can take steps to encrypt any sensitive information on your phone by using specific tools.

### Data encryption tools ###

The [**Android Privacy Guard (APG)**](/en/APG_main) allows OpenGPG encryption for files and emails. It can be used to keep your files and documents safe on your phone, as well when emailing.

[**Cryptonite**](https://code.google.com/p/cryptonite/) is another [*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS) files encryption tool. Cryptonite has more advanced features on specially prepared rooted Android phones with a custom firmware. See the [***Advanced Smartphone Use***](/en/chapter_11_7) section for more.

### Secure password keeping ###

You can keep all your needed passwords in one secure, encrypted file by using **Keepass**. You will only need to remember one master password to access all the others. With Keepass you can use very strong passwords for each account you have, as Keepass will remember them for you, and it also comes with a password generator to create new passwords. You can synchronise Keepass password databases between your phone and your computer. We recommned that you synchronise only those passwords that you will actually use on your mobile phone. You can create a separate smaller password database on the computer and syncronise this one instead of coping an entire database with all the passwords that you use to your smartphone. Also, since all the passwords are protected by your master password, it is vital to use very strong password for your Keepass database. See [***Chapter 3: How to create and maintain secure passwords***](/en/chapter-3).
