- More information on backup and data recovery can be found in the *2.3 Information Backup, Destruction and Recovery* chapter of the [Digital Security and Privacy for Human Rights Defenders](http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/esecman) book.
- Note that online backup brings new risks. At minimum, **remember to encrypt your sensitive information separately yourself** before you upload it to
the server. Assuming you do the step above, there are free online data storage services as a convenient way to back up your information. Some
options include: [Wuala](https://www.wuala.com/), [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/), [Google
Drive](https://drive.google.com/start), [tahoe-lafs](https://tahoe-lafs.org/trac/tahoe-lafs). 
- There is an excellent article on data recovery in [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_recovery).
