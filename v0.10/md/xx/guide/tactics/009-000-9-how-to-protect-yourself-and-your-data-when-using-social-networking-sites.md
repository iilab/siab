title: 9. How to protect yourself and your data when using social networking sites

---

Online communities have existed since the invention of the internet. First there were bulletin boards and email lists, which gave people around the world opportunities to connect, to communicate and to share information about particular subjects. Today, social networking websites have greatly expanded the range of possible interactions, allowing you to share messages, pictures, files and even up-to-the-minute information about what you are doing and where you are. These functions are not new or unique â€“ any of these actions can also be performed via the internet without joining a social networking site.

Although these networks can be very useful, and promote social interaction both online and offline, when using them you may be making information available to people who want to abuse it. Think of a social networking site as being like a huge party. There are people there that you know, as well as some that you don't know at all. Imagine walking through the party with all your personal details, and up-to-the-minute accounts of what you are thinking, written on a big sign stuck on your back so that everyone can read it without you even knowing. Do you really want everyone to know all about you? 

Remember that social networking sites are owned by private businesses, and that they make their money by collecting data about individuals and selling that data on, particularly to third party advertisers. When you enter a social networking site, you are leaving the freedoms of the internet behind and are entering a network that is governed and ruled by the owners of the site. Privacy settings are only meant to protect you from other members of the social network, but they do not shield your data from the owners of the service. Essentially you are giving all your data over to the owners and trusting them with it. 

If you work with sensitive information and topics, and are interested in using social networking services, it is important to be very aware of the privacy and security issues that they raise. Human rights advocates are particularly vulnerable to the dangers of social networking sites and need to be extremely careful about the information they reveal about themselves AND about the people they work with. 

Before you use any social networking site it is important to understand how they make you vulnerable, and then take steps to protect yourself and the people you work with. This guide will help you understand the security implications of using social networking sites.

## Background Scenario: ##

<div class="background" markdown=1>
Mansour and Magda are human rights defenders from north Africa. They are organising a march, to take place in the middle of a large city. They want to use Facebook to publicise the event. They are worried that the authorities could be tipped off and that anyone who shows an interest could be traced. They plan to use Twitter during the march to give updates on the progress of the march. But what if the police could monitor the tweets, and deploy squads to intercept marchers? Mansour and Magda plan how to share photos and videos of the march without revealing people's identities, because they worry that participants could face persecution.

We do not encourage you to stop using social networking tools altogether. However you should take proper security measures, so that you can use these tools without making yourself or anyone else vulnerable.
