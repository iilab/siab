title: Recovering from accidental file deletion

---

When you delete a file in Windows, it disappears from view, but its contents remain on the computer. Even after you empty the **Recycle Bin**, information from the files you deleted can usually still be found on the hard drive. See [***Chapter 6: How to destroy sensitive information***](/en/chapter-6) to learn more about this. Occasionally, if you accidentally delete an important file or folder, this security vulnerability can work to your advantage. There are several programs that can restore access to recently-deleted files, including a tool called [*Recuva*](/en/recuva_main).

These tools do not always work, because Windows may have written new data over your deleted information. Therefore, it is important that you do as little as possible with your computer between deleting a file and attempting to restore it with a tool like [*Recuva*](/en/recuva_main). The longer you use your computer before attempting to restore the file, the less likely it is that you will succeed. This also means that you should use the portable version of *Recuva* instead of installing it after deleting an important file. Installing the software requires writing new information to the file system, which may coincidentally overwrite the critical data that you are trying to recover.

While it might sound like a lot of work to implement the policies and learn the tools described in this chapter, maintaining your backup strategy, once you have a system in place, is much easier than setting it up for the first time. And, given that backup may be the single most important aspect of data security, you can rest assured that going through this process is well worth the effort.
