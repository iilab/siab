title: 10. How to use mobile phones as securely as possible

---

Mobile phones are an integral part of our daily communications. All mobile phones have the capacity for voice and simple text messaging services. Their small size, relatively low cost and many uses make these devices invaluable for rights advocates who increasingly use them for communication and organisation. 

Recently, mobile devices with many more functions have become available. They may feature [GPS](/en/glossary#GPS), multimedia capacity (photo, video and audio recording and sometimes transmitting), data processing and access to the internet. However, the way the mobile networks operate, and their infrastructure, are fundamentally different from how the internet works. This creates additional security challenges, and risks for users' privacy and  the integrity of their information and communications.

It is important to start with the understanding that mobile phones are inherently insecure:

* Information sent from a mobile phone is vulnerable.
* Information stored on mobile phones is vulnerable.
* Phones are designed to give out information about their location.

We will explore these issues, and what a user can do in light of these inherent vulnerabilities.

## Background scenario ##

<div class="background">
Borna and his son Delir are both line workers in a factory, and are helping to create a workers' union. Their efforts are meeting the resistance of the factory owners, who are also well-connected in their local government. Borna's supervisor has warned him that he may be under scrutiny by management, and to beware of who he talks to. Borna has purchased a mobile phone for his union work. Delir is helping his father to use his new mobile phone safely for some of his organising activities.
