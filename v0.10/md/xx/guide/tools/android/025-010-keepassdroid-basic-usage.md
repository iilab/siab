## 2.1 How to Create a New Password Database ##

In the sections that follow, you will be taught how to create a master password, save your newly-created database, generate a random password for a particular program and create a backup copy of the database.

**Step 1**. To open **KeePassDroid** you **tap** the application's icon.

![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/keepassdroid.png)

**Step 2**. To create a new password database, **tap** *create*. 

![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/005.png)

*Figure 3: Open/create database screen.*

This will activate the *Enter database password* screen as below:

![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/006.png)

*Figure 4: Enter database password screen.*

**Step 3**. In this step you will create a single, unique and strong master password, which you **must** remember, that will be used to lock and unlock your database of passwords.

**Type** in the master password you have invented into the *password* and *confirm password* fields as shown below:

![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/007.png)

*Figure 5: Enter a master password*

**Tip**: Have a look at [**3. How to create and maintain good passwords**](/en/chapter_3_1) for more information on how to create a strong master password.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your secure password database. Now you can use it to safely store all your current and future passwords.

**Note**: If you use KeePass on another mobile device or computer, you can copy its database to your device and then open it with **KeePassDroid** or **KeePass**.

## 2.2. How to Add Entries to your Database ##

<a name="2.2.1"></a>
### 2.2.1 Adding a Group
**KeePassDroid** stores passwords entries in groups to keep your information organized, the default groups are **eMail** and **Internet**, but you can create your own group by **tapping** ![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/009.png), typing the name of the group and then ![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/010.png).

*Figures 7 and 8: Adding a new group*

**Tap** your newly created group to open it and begin adding password entries.

### 2.2.2 Adding Passwords
The **Add entry** screen lets you add account information, passwords and other important details into your newly-created database. 

**Step 1**. **Tap** ![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/013.png) to activate the *Add Entry* screen as follows:

![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/014.png)

*Figures 9: Adding a new password entry.*

**Note**: The *Add Entry* screen presents you with a number of fields to be completed. Only the *Name* field in figure 9 above is mandatory; information submitted here is largely for your own convenience. Filling them in may prove useful in situations where you are searching for a particular entry.

A brief explanation of these different text boxes is presented as follows:

  - **Name**: A name to describe the particular password entry. For example, your *twitter* account.

  - **Username**: The user name associated with the password entry. For example, *TherobotONO*

  - **URL**: The internet site associated with the password entry. For example, *https://twitter.com*

  - **Password**: The password for your account. This section also allows you to [*generate a random password*](/en/keepassdroid_advanced_use#3.1) if you do not want to come up with one your self.

  - **Confirm passwords**: The confirmation of the password.

  - **Comments**: This is where you type in descriptive or general information about the account or site for which you are storing information. For example: Mail server settings: *POP3 SSL, pop.gmail.com, Port 995; SMTP TLS, smtp.gmail.com, Port: 465*

**Note**: Creating or modifying the password entries in **KeePassDroid** does not update your account password! Think of **KeePassDroid** as a secure electronic address book for your passwords. It only stores what you write in it, nothing more.

**Step 2**. **Tap** **save** to save your changes.

Your new entry now appears in the group.

## 2.3 Copying a KeePassDroid password

Given that a secure password is not easily memorized, **KeePassDroid** lets you copy it from the database and paste it onto whatever account or website requires it.

**Step 1**. Open the password entry you wish to use and **tap** the menu icon (![](/sbox/screen/keepassdroid-en-1/016.png)):
