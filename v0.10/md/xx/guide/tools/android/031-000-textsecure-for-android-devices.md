## 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ##

- Using this application will prevent anyone from being able to read the content of your text messages, but will not hide the fact that you are sending messages.

- TextSecure will only hide who the messages are being sent to when your phone connects to Internet and messages are sent over data connection through *WhisperSync* server. Traditional SMS, encrypted or not, will still disclose the recipient(s) to your mobile phone company.

- In some countries, an encryption programme such as **TextSecure** may attract attention, be illegal or subject to legal constraints.
