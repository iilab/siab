## 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ##

- **ObscuraCam**'s automatic face-recognition does not always work, but you can easily select and obscure faces manually.
- On some versions of the Android operating system, the option to *delete the original media file* does not work. If you rely on this option, please check to make sure that you do not have **ObscuraCam** photos (with visible faces!) somewhere on your device.
- If you use **ObscuraCam** to send photos to yourself or to someone else, the tool **does not** provide additional protection (such as end-to-end encryption) for the photo in transit.
- A **tag** is an area in the photo which has been obscured by one of several methods **ObscuraCam** can use.
