## 2.0 About Firefox ##
**Firefox** has many easy-to-use settings for protecting your privacy and security whenever you access the Internet. How frequently you may have to configure these settings depends on your particular situation: 

- If you are using your personal computer, and do not allow others to use it for browsing purposes, you need only configure these settings once. 

- If you are in a public location or at work, you may have to repeatedly re-configure these settings for your own use. 

**Note**: You may also use a portable version of **Firefox** on a USB memory stick with you. This lets you configure **Firefox** according to your requirements, and you can use this version on any public computer. For more information about **Firefox** portable, please refer to [**Mozilla Firefox, Portable Edition**](/en/firefox_portable).

## 2.1 How to Install Firefox ##

Installing **Firefox** is a simple and straightforward process. To begin installing **Firefox**, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Double click**  ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-01.png); the *User Account Control* dialog box may appear, asking you if you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC. If it does, **click** "Yes"  to activate the *Extracting* progress status bar.

*A few moments later, the The Welcome to the Firefox Setup Wizard window will appear.* 

**Step 2**. **Follow** the steps in the guided installation process, and simply accept the default options and settings.

**Note**: Do not change the default options and settings unless you know what you are doing and why you are doing so.

**Setting Firefox as a default browser**

When you open for the first time Firefox, it will show you a dialog box where you can choose the option **Use Firefox as my default browser**. When you click on it, Windows is going to automatically open the settings for choosing default apps. Scroll down and get to the option Web Browser, click on **Microsoft Edge** and choose Firefox. Close the Settings dialog and you are ready to go.

*Figure 2: The Options window displaying the default General pane*

**Tip**: **Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-06.png) if the *General* pane is not automatically displayed as shown in *Figure 2* above. 

The *General* pane lets you configure a few basic **Firefox** settings, among them your preferred home page, the location of your *Downloads* folder and how you want your tabs configured.

The default setting for the *When Firefox starts* drop-down menu is *Show my home page*, and the default home page is the *Mozilla Firefox Start Page*.

**Tip**: **Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-07.png) to automatically set the page you are on and you know it to be trustworthy as your home page.

In the **Tab** Section we recommend that you click on the option *Don't load tabs until selected*, as sometimes it happens that tabs are opening without us selecting them or selecting by mistake, so it is very useful that those are not loading unless you click on them.

## 2.3 How to Configure the Privacy pane options ##

The *Privacy* pane lets you manage privacy and security options for the browser. 

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-08.png) to activate the following screen: 

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-09.png)

*Figure 3: The Options window displaying the Privacy pane*

The *Privacy* pane is divided into three sections: The *Tracking* section, the *History* section and the *Location bar* section. 

- **The Tracking section**

The *Do Not Track* section lets you determine whether you wish your internet activities and behaviors to be monitored or tracked by third parties, for instance, advertising companies, analytic services, or market researchers. The first time **Firefox** is installed, by default the setting "Tell sites I do not want to be tracked option" is not checked and must be changed; by enabling the option it notifies participating companies and organizations that you do not wish to be tracked.

**Note**: The *Do Not Track* option is based on an honor system and is voluntary; as such, individual web sites are neither legally nor technically compelled to respect such requests. Although a growing number of respectful and responsible organizations are participants, the *Do Not Track* option must be complemented by other add-ons or plugins that effectively target the commercial or malicious interests; enabling this option reduces your exposure to potentially harmful advertisements online. For more information about **Firefox** add-ons, please refer to [**More Useful Firefox Add-Ons**](/en/firefox_others).

*Figure 4: The Tracking section*

**Step 1**. **Check** the *Tell sites I do not want to be tracked* option (as shown in *Figure 4* above) to have your privacy and security respected by the participants.

- **The History section**

The *History* section lets you manage your **Firefox** browser 'history', that is, a list of all the different sites you have visited since you began using **Firefox**. The default *Firefox will:* option is *Remember history* and must be changed to protect your internet privacy and security. 

To eliminate traces of your browsing history, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Activate** the *Firefox will:* drop-down list and **select** the *Never remember history* item. 

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-15.png)

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-11.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-12.png)

*Figure 5: The Clear All History window*

**Step 3**. **Select** all check-boxes and **click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-13.png) to clear **Firefox** of all potentially revealing data, and return to the *Privacy* pane. 

**Tip**: If the *Form & Search History* option is grey and does not let you to check the box, you will need to first use the search option in the Firefox Menu, 

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-16.png), 

and then open ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-11.png) again. This time *Form & Search History* will be checked.

- **The Location Bar section**

The *Location Bar* section uses addresses, cookies and other temporary data from bookmarked web sites, and the web history to prompt or suggest addresses in the **Firefox** **Universal Resource Locator** (**URL**) bar for your browsing convenience. The default *When using the location bar, suggest:* option has checked *History, Bookmarks and Open Tabs*, and must be changed to protect your internet privacy and security. 

To eliminate traces of your browsing habits and history, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Uncheck** the boxes *History, Bookmarks and Open Tabs*  as shown in *Figure 6* below and *Figure 3* above:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-14.png)

*Figure 6: The Location section displaying the unchecked boxes*

**Note**: For a more secure and thorough approach to deleting temporary data, please refer to the chapter on [**CCleaner**](/en/ccleaner_main).

## 2.4 How to Configure the Security pane options ##

The *Security* pane is divided into two sections: the first deals with potentially threatening actions from external sources and the second, or *Passwords* section, with password management. 

**Note**: For more information on password storage, please refer to the chapter on [**KeePass**](/en/keepass_main).

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-17.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-18.png)

*Figure 7: The Options window displaying the Security pane*

**Step 2**. **Accept** the default settings in the first section. 

- **The Passwords section**

The *Passwords* section lets you manage your passwords. If the *Remember passwords for sites* option is enabled, it must be disabled to ensure your password privacy and security. We recommend to securely store passwords in [**KeePass**](/en/keepass_main).

## 2.5 How to Configure the Advanced pane options ##

The *Advanced* tab, as its name suggests, is designed with the **Advanced** or **Experienced** **Firefox** user in mind. However, users of *all* levels will benefit from enabling the following option in the *General* tab. 

**Click** ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-19.png) to activate the Advanced tab

- The *Warn me when websites try to redirect or reload the page* option enables **Firefox** to prevent web sites from automatically redirecting you to another page, or reloading themselves without your consent or knowledge. 

![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-20.png)

*Figure 8: The Advanced pane options with the default General tab displayed*

**Step 1. Enable** checkbox *Warn me when websites try to redirect or reload the page* option as shown in *Figure 8* above.

**Step 2. Choose** the ![](/sites/securityinabox.org/files/media/firefox-win-en-001.png) tab and click the {Clear Now} button in the *Cache section*, to manually delete the traces of your work in Firefox, like shown bellow in *Figure 9*

## 2.4 How private is the private browsing option ##

Every browser now offers the *private browsing option*. It is called private browsing in Firefox and Safari or incognito window in Chrome and Chromium. The goal is to browse privately not letting others know which sites have we visited and make it impossible for sites to identify us.

This has to be done by deleting or prevention of creating history entries, cached items, cookies etc. The function of the private browsing option should be ensuring that browsers do not send any cookies or other identifiable information. However it is not like that. 

**Be careful** Browsers have not isolated their private sessions from the public ones so private sessions are actually not that private. There are ways to retrieve the information which sites have been visited in private mode and even when browsing in private mode, sites can still receive identifiable information about our browser.

**Note** Please go to **How to configure Firefox** to make your browser safer and see our sections on **No Script** and **Other useful Add-ons** for better security and control over your browsers, but also visit our section about **Tor** for anonymity.
