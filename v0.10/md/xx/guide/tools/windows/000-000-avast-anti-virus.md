**Version used in this guide**:

- 10.0

**Last revision of this chapter**

- November 2014

**License**:

- Freeware 
	
**Required Reading**:

- **How-to Booklet** chapter [**1. Protecting your Computer from Viruses, Malware and Hackers**](/chapter-1)

**What you will get in return**:

- The ability to scan for and remove viruses from your computer
- The ability to protect your computer from new virus infections
- The ability to receive free program version and virus definition updates from the Internet

**GNU Linux, Mac OS and other Microsoft Windows Compatible Programs**:

Although we recommend **avast! Free Antivirus** in this chapter, there are other free anti-malware programs compatible with **Microsoft Windows** that are worth recommending as well: 

- [**Avira Free Antivirus**](https://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus);
- [**AVG Anti-Virus Free**](http://free.avg.com/);
- [**Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition**](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html);

Also if you can afford to purchase a commercial version of the anti-virus software for **Microsoft Windows** it may offer you more complete protection.

Although operating systems like **GNU Linux** and **Mac OS** are more resistant towards viruses, there are compelling reasons for installing an anti-malware program on them. Firstly, there is increasing number of viruses created for these operating systems, and secondly, you may risk spreading viruses that run on MS Windows unknowingly, even if your own system remains immune to them.

**Mac OS** or **Google Android** users can install free versions of **Avast!**, **Avira** or **AVG**.

At present, unfortunately, there are no anti-virus programs that we are comfortable recommending for **Linux**. We see this as a strong insecurity and increasing need for **Linux** operating system.

### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

Computer viruses are malicious programs that can destroy files, spy on your activity, slow your computer down and use your address book to locate and infect other computers. **avast!** can protect your system against viruses that might infect your computer through downloads from the Internet, email attachments, or transfers from removable media (CDs, DVDs, USB memory sticks, etc).

- Make sure that you do not have two anti-virus programs installed and running at the same time. If you are currently using a different program and you want to switch to **avast!**, you must first uninstall the other anti-virus program before installing **avast!**.

- New malware and viruses are being developed all the time. The **avast!** database and program itself must be kept up-to-date to effectively protect your computer.

- Among the more insidious viruses are those which can actually prevent the installation or running of **avast!**, and/or viruses that **avast!** can fail to detect and delete. In these kinds of situations, fairly advanced methods are required, and some of those are discussed in section [**4.9 Advanced Virus Removal Methods**](/en/dealingwithviruses#4.9).
