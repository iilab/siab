## 4.1 Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Spybot - Search & Destroy ##

Given that portable tools are not installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses.

There are no other differences between **Portable Spybot** and the version designed to be installed on a local computer.

**Note:** Please review the portable rescue tools for removing the viruses, adware, malware and spyware in the avast! Hands-on Guide chapter page [**Advanced Virus Removal Methods**](/en/dealingwithviruses#4.9) section of *How to Scan for and Deal with Viruses Using avast!*.
