## 5.0 About the Add-ons ##

## 5.1 How to Use HTTPS Everywhere##

![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/httpseverywherelogo.png)

**HTTPS Everywhere** is a **Mozilla Firefox** extension ensuring that you always communicate with specified list of websites over an encrypted (*https*) channel. Although many websites do offer encryption, they tend default to an unencrypted http address. The **HTTPS Everywhere** extension fixes these problems by rewriting all your requests to these sites to the **HTTPS** protocol. It runs silently in the background, ensuring that your Internet sessions with those selected sites are safe and secure. However, it works *only* when those sites are using the **HTTPS** protocol themselves.

After the **HTTPS Everywhere** extension has been successfully installed, the following screen will appear:

*Figure 1: The Should HTTPS Everywhere Use the SSL Observatory? prompt screen*

*Figure 2: The SSL Observatory Preferences screen* 

**Note**: If there has been a previous installation of **HTTPS Everywhere** on your **Firefox** browser, **select Tools > HTTPS Everywhere > SSL Observatory Preferences** and verify that the *Use the Observatory* and *When you see a new certificate, tell the Observatory which ISP you are connected to* options are enabled. If you are not using **Tor**, **enable** the *Check certificates even if Tor is not available* option as well.

![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/adblockpluslogo.png)

If you work in multiple languages, **click** ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/65.png) to view different filter subscriptions, then **click** ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/66.png) to activate a drop-down list of different subscription filters, **select** the appropriate one, and then **click**  ![](/sbox/screen/firefox-en-1/67.png).
