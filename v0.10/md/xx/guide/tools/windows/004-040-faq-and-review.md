## 5.0 FAQ and Review ##

**KeePass** is a very easy program to use. The important part is getting into the habit of creating new passwords in **KeePass**. It may be difficult to get used to the fact that you never have to see a password again, but it is definitely easier than having to remember them!

***Q***: *On the outside chance that I forget my master password, is there anything I can do to access **KeePass** and retrieve my password databases?*

***A***: *No. There is nothing you can do in that situation. On the bright side, at least no one else will be able to access your password database! To prevent this from happening, you could use some of the methods for remembering a password that are described in the How-to Booklet chapter [**3. How to create and maintain good passwords**](/en/chapter-3).*

***Q***: *And if I uninstall **KeePass**, what will happen to my passwords?*

***A***: *The program will be deleted from your computer; however, your database (stored in a .kdb file) will remain. You can open this file at any time in the future if you install **KeePass** again.*

***Q***: *I think I accidentally deleted the database file!*

***A***: *Hopefully, you made a backup beforehand. Also, make sure you haven't simply forgotten where you stored the file in the first place. Search your computer for a file with a .kdb extension. If you really have deleted it, take a look at the Hands-on guide to [**Recuva**](/en/recuva). It could help you to recover the file.*
