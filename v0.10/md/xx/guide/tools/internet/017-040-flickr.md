### 1.1 Things you should know about this tool before you start ###

**Flickr** is owned by Yahoo! and also facilitates integration with other accounts including Google and Facebook. Content posted on **Flickr** remains yours, to which you can attribute different creative commons licenses or copyright. You are giving Yahoo! a license to distribute your photos or videos by submitting content. Because of the diverse licensing attribution, **Flickr** is great both for finding pictures to be used in campaigns and as a resource for sharing images with colleagues, allies and members of your networks. However,  it's highly likely that **Flickr** user data is gathered and monitored by a number of governments.

For more information, read on Yahoo!'s [**Privacy Policy**](http://privacy.yahoo.com).

## Updating your Flickr privacy settings ##

**Step 1.** In order to access the Privacy & Permissions settings on **Flickr**, **login** to you **Flickr** account using **Mozilla Firefox** browser and **click** the icon in the top right of the screen and **choose** *Settings*. 

**Step 2.** From the main *settings* page, select *Privacy & Permissions*.

**Step 3.** By default, Flickr allows anyone to see your pictures. If you would like more privacy, **click** *edit* on the *Who can access your original image files* option and **choose** *Only you*. Then **click** *Save*.

**Step 4.** By default, **Flickr** allows people who can access your content to share it more widely on sites such as Facebook or Twitter. This would mean that, in the case of sensitive images, they could easily fall into the wrong hands. In order for only you to decide how the images are shared, it is reccommended that you disable this option. To do so, **click** on *edit* beside *Allow others to share your stuff* and **select** *No, thanks*. Then **click** *Save*.

**Step 5.** By default, **Flickr** allows any other member to tag you in photos. This could prove dangerous, for example, should someone add tag you in a photo of a protest or other kind of civil disobedience. Therefore, it's reccommended that you **select** *Only you* to be able to tag yourself in pictures.

**Step 6.** By default, **Flickr** shares your **EXIF** data - that is, the metadata from your pictures such as the make and model of your camera, the location and time at which the photo was taken, etc. -- with other users. As this information can be sensitive, it is reccommended that you do not share it.

**Step 7.** By default, **Flickr** makes your pictures and public profile accessible via search engines. For more privacy and control over who can access your information and pictures, it is reccommended that you **hide** your profile and pictures from public searches.

**Step 8.** **New uploads**: Flickr's default settings promote as much sharing of information and interaction as possible when you upload new content. It is reccommended that you choose more private default options, such as: 

*  Disallowing others to immediately view, share or comment on your newly uploaded photos
*  Disallowing others to view the location data or your newly uploaded photos
*  Allowing only a restricted audience access to your newly uploaded photos

These settings can, of course, be changed on a per-upload basis, should you want to include EXIF data as evidence, for example.

### Alternatives to Flickr ### 

If you do not wish to associate your pictures with your **Yahoo**, **Google** or **Facebook** profiles, there may be alternatives. Other similar sites may be popular in different regions, so you way wish to explore other options. Before choosing one you should consider the following points:

1. Does it provide connection over **SSL** for all uses of the site, rather than just during login? Are there no problems related to encryption, such as problems related to encryption certificates?
2. Read the End User Licence Agreement and Privacy Policy or Data Use Policy carefully. How are your content, photos and personal data treated? With whom are they shared?
3. What privacy options are provided for users? Can you choose to share your photos securely with a small number of individuals, or are they all public by default? 
4. If you will upload sensitive images, such as footage of a protest, does the site facilitate protection of those you have photographs, such as through face-blurring?
4. Do you know the **geographical location of the servers**, under which territorial jurisdiction they fall or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information? Will the site's owners hand over information if they receive a governmental request to do so?
