## 5.0 FAQ ##

<div class="background" markdown="1"> 

***Q: I cannot log in to my Riseup account***

***A**: Please see the [Troubleshooting webmail login](https://help.riseup.net/en/email/webmail#troubleshooting-webmail-login) in [Riseup Email Help](https://help.riseup.net/email). Also see [Riseup Help: Frequently asked questions](https://help.riseup.net/en/email#frequently-asked-questions-faq) for many other topics.*

***Q: In which circumstances would I use the default (Roundcube) as opposed to the SquirrelMail web email interface?***

***A**: If for some reason, one email interface is down or has to undergo routine maintenance, you can always continue working on the other email interface without interruption. Also, the **SquirrelMail** service does not require JavaScript.*

***Q: When creating my account I am uncomfortable giving information about my self, do I have to supply this.***

***A**: No, you are not required to supply any personal information unless you want to.*

***Q: How can I create an email account for an activist that I know?***

***A**: You need to know another **Riseup** user and both of you need to generate an [invite code](/en/riseup_changingsettings#4.3) each and send this to your colleague. The codes will be used when this person creates a **Riseup** account.*

***Q: I noticed the two-factor authentication setting in the Roundcube web mail interface, should I use it?***

***A**:  Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of protection to your email account by requiring the entry of a random, changing code in addition to your password when login in. However at this time even if you set it up and activate you can still access your emails without a need to use two-factor authentication with **SquirrelMail** web mail interface or with an email client (like Thunderbird) over POP/IMAP access. We are looking forward to further development of the two-factor authentication support on **Riseup**.*
