## 1.0 Differences between the Installed and Portable Versions of Portable CCleaner ##

Given that portable tools are *not* installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses. 

There are no other differences between **Portable CCleaner**, and this version can be installed on a local computer as well.
