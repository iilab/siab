title: Digital Threats to the LGBTI community

---

This section includes an overview of the situation of some of the digital threats and vulnerabilities faced by LGBTI human rights defenders and persons in the forty-seven sub Saharan African countries. These threats arise from our use of computers, the Internet and mobile phones in order to carry out our work, establish networks and communities, and express our identities. 

Marginalisation and attacks against the LGBTI community in the region come in various forms and arise from, unfortunately, a widespread attitude of social and political hostility towards the community. In Africa, members of the LGBTI community face insults, threats and exclusion from family members on the discovery of their sexual orientation or gender identity status. LGBTI persons across the region often find themselves victims of a witch-hunt mentality, led by family, community or State, and are desperate to conceal their identities or orientations lest they be targeted. 

Although there are exceptions, **religious institutions, both Muslim and Christian, tend to also foster hostility towards the LGBTI community**. Many religious leaders even preach against homosexuality and advise their followers not to accept the practice.

Because homosexuality is still viewed as "un-African" in a large part of the region, politicians and religious  leaders speak loudly against LGBTI groups to gain traction. Some religious leaders view homosexuality as a threat to traditional, socio-cultural and moral beliefs and values and perceive it as a negative western culture that should not be accepted. **Other political campaigns translate into hateful demagoguery which is then used to get votes**, and to distract people from political, social, and economic failings. Such campaigns translate into violence, ostracism, and oppression that LGBTI people have to face on a daily basis. In 2014, laws were passed in Nigeria and Uganda imposing harsher criminalisation of homosexuality, and were followed by campaigns of persecution by homophobic elements of society.  

These are not the only threats faced by LGBTI persons in the region. With the proliferation of mobile phones and smartphones, computers and Internet access in the region, LGBTI people have taken to these new means of communication in order to express their identities and build networks of contacts and communities. However, **homophobic elements of State and society are equally present on this new media and are discovering new, technological means of attacking the community**. The use of mobiles, social media platforms, email and dating sites in harassment, bullying, sexual violence, and even as a means of gathering evidence for prosecution is increasingly common. This section will outline the major risks from a *digital security* perspective faced by LGBTI persons in the region and link into sections of the toolkit which can help us to avoid these kinds of attacks.

Among the most common digital threats faced by the community are:

* [**Access to accounts and devices**](#1327)
* [**Evidence for prosecution**](#1328)
* [**Entrapment and extortion**](#1329)
* [**Harassment, physical and sexual attacks**](#1330)
* [**Malware infection**](#1331)
* [**Monitoring and Tracking**](#1332)



# Access to Accounts and Devices
**The problem:**

Breach of privacy leading to ‘outing’ is one of the biggest fears some LGBTI persons face within the region. A common way for this to happen is by having one's computer or devices accessed by someone else who can then see the sensitive information stored on them. This information include your:

* work documents;
* pictures or videos;
* previous browsing history;
* dating apps;
* private email conversations;
* SMS or various chatting apps

This kind of breach of privacy can happen through simple acts such as lending your device to a friend, or having it stolen. However, we also need to consider the risk of **computers being searched or confiscated for political reasons** or for purposes of extortion. There are many examples of LGBTI human rights defenders or organisations having their homes or offices raided, by law enforcement or private individuals. Computers and other devices are very often stolen or confiscated in these attacks. Sometimes, a raid can take place under the pretext of searching for "ponography" or "indecent material", which can be intepreted quite openly, and used to further stigmatise the LGBTI community. In this case, the material on the **computers and their browsing history will usually be searched for examples**.

**Staying safe:**
With increasing social and legal persecution of LGBTI people, we need to take action to protect our devices and accounts from unwanted access. Luckily, we can be much more secure by taking just a few simple steps: 

* First, we should **protect our devices and accounts with [strong passwords](passwords)** with the help of programs like [*KeePass*](keepass/windows). 
* We should **use a trustable browser** like Mozilla [*Firefox with Add-Ons*](firefox/windows) and get to know its privacy settings. Or, we can use the [*Tor Browser*](torbrowser/windows) which facilitates anonymous browsing online and which won't remember your browsing history.
* For even stronger security, we can **encrypt our sensitive material, or our entire hard drives** with programs like [*TrueCrypt*](truecrypt/windows). Full disk encryption is even built into many operating systems, such as Windows Professional, Mac OS X, many Linux systems, as well smartphone systems such as Android 4.0 or later, and iOS, although it often has to be activated manually.
*  If you use internet on a shared computer or an Internet Café, ensure that when logging into your account you never activate the option for *Remain logged in*, *Remember me* or *Save my password*. Also, be sure to **clear your browsing history, search history and browser cache** if you were visiting any LGBTI-related pages.

# Evidence for prosecution
**The problem:**

Although arrest and detention without trial are common for LGBTI people in the region, until recently, arrests that lead to prosecution were rare; only a handful of cases have been recorded in the past decade within the region. As mentioned above, however, **law enforcement in a number of countries are beginning to rely on accessing individuals' emails, text messages, and documents contained in devices** to gather proof for prosecution on the basis of sexuality. In many cases, police simply use this evidence to extort money from individuals eager to avoid formal charges.

**Staying safe:**

Protecting ourselves is not just about protecting our own data, but that of our communities too. Knowing how to communicate securely is more important than ever, as many popular platforms like WhatsApp, Facebook and others are not designed with user privacy in mind. However, there are alternatives: 

* We can **chat securel**y over our mobile devices using apps like [*TextSecure*](textsecure/android) and [*ChatSecure*](chatsecure/android). 
* We can chat and **make voice and video calls online securely** with our contacts using programs like [*Jitsi*](jitsi/windows). 
* We can **encrypt our emails** and make them inaccessible to unwanted eyes by using [*Gpg4usb*](gpg4usb/windows) or [*Thunderbird with Enigmail*](thunderbird/windows). 
* We can even get off insecure platforms like Facebook and **explore alternatives** such as [*Crabgrass*](crabgrass/internet).

This way, you can reduce the risks of having emails intercepted or accessed, and establish secure communications with people in your network. It's important to note however that these tools will not protect against the person with whom you communicate sharing or publicising your private messages.

# Entrapment and Extortion
**The problem:**

Dating sites and social networks have provided members of the LGBTI community with new potential for communicating and establishing partnerships, networks and communities. However, these tools are also being used by homophobic elements of the State and society to entrap LGBTI people and subject them to humiliation, extortion, or even violence. Attacks are increasingly common whereby individuals or groups — be they civilian or police — **set up fake profiles on gay dating sites or social networks and use them to lure people into meetings**. Users of the site may unwittingly believe they are arranging to meet someone like them, but upon meeting they are attacked. 


{{ snippet: ./002-snippet_04.md }}

**Staying safe:**

Avoiding snooping and entrapment on dating sites and social networks is partly technical, but is mostly to do with our behaviour: 

* For a start, it's a good idea to only **connect to dating sites securely and anonymously** such as through using the [*Tor Browser*](torbrowser/windows) 
* Or as a minimum, by enabling the [*HTTPS Everywhere*](https://eff.org/https-everywhere) add-on to the [*Firefox*](firefox/windows) browser. 
* It's important to **delete our browsing history and cookies** after each session, or have them disabled to begin with. 

However, most of the solutions are behavioural, not technical. We should never associate any identifiable information on a dating site. We must also **be very careful when exchanging pictures** and only do so once significant trust has been established. First meetings with new people should only be in a safe, public place.

# Harassment, physical and sexual attacks
**The problem:**

Within the sub-Saharan African region, members of the LGBTI community face insults, threats and exclusion from family members on the discovery of their sexual orientation and gender identity status. Moreover, our identities and work often fly in the face of heteronormative social structures and misogyny. As a result, **the violence faced by LGBTI people is structural, physical, and often sexualised**. Harassment, violence, rape, and in some cases murder have been recorded against members of the community.

Now, many of these threats have expanded into the online space. Online bullying is a form of harrasment which may include repeatedly taunting, ganging up, threatening, or name calling individuls to cause harm or discomfort. Because of the proliferation of social networking and communication platforms, and the fact that people often feel anonymous when using them, online and social media bullying are very prevalent and LGBTI persons and groups are not exempt from it. On the contrary, a lot of people have been 'outed' to their family because of their posts and behaviour online while others have been harrassed for being LGBTI, posting LGBTI-related content or showing support for the community. Seemingly random conversations have been known to turn into homophobic threads and in a some situations, what begins as online harassment turns into real-life violence.


{{ snippet: ./002-snippet_05.md }}

Smartphone chat apps like *WhatsApp*, *Viber*, or *2go* can access our phone numbers and provide them to the whole world without our permission and give potential harrassers direct access to us. Some apps also encourage us to share our location information and who we are with; this information could also be used to facilitate an attack. 

**Staying safe:**

For more on how to keep your phones safe, keep your browsing history to yourself and avoid sharing your location information that may lead to attacks, see:

* [*How to keep your Internet communication private*(]secure-communication)
* [*How to use mobile phones as securely as possible*](mobile-phones)
* [*How to use smartphones as securely as possible*](smartphones)

Regarding harassment, as a general rule, it is advisable not to engage in arguments with people online who only want to spread hate: your discomfort only encourages them to continue. It is also unwise to share or confirm intimate details about yourself with unknown persons as they can use that to target you. For more, see:

* [*How to protect yourself and your data when using social networking sites*](social-networking)




# Malware infection
**The problem:**

Access to technology and education on how computers work and how to use them in the most hygienic way is quite limited in the region. Most people learn to use computers "by doing" and don't get much theoretical background on how computers work, and basic measures to keep a computer healthy - that is to say, free of malicious software. This is exacerbated by a number of factors. In particular, due to limited resources, many people do not obtain registered copies of proprietary software such as *Microsoft Windows* or *Microsoft Office*, and instead rely on "cracked" or unlicensed versions. **Many of these "cracked" softwares are themselves malicious**, or at best, they leave us vulnerable to malware infections. Furthermore, many of us rely on using internet cafés for access to the internet, and are unaware of whether or not the computers are infected. This can have a very damaging effect, as infection of our computer or USB memory devices can lead to data loss, or facilitate spying on our activities. 

"Phishing" is also often used as a technique to trick unsuspecting users into handing over their passwords for e-mail or other personal accounts. This often takes the form of an e-mail, which looks as though it was sent by a person or company known to you, which usually invites you to download an attachment (often a virus) or click on a link where you are prompted to sign in to your e-mail or other account, and enter your password. If this information falls into the wrong hands, it could lead to our sensitive and personal information falling into the public domain, or worse.

**Staying safe:**

To be more effective advocates, **we must protect our information from malware and hackers**. It's important for us to make use of Free and Open Source ([*FOSS*](/en/glossary#FOSS)) operating systems (like Linux) and programs (like Mozilla Firefox): these programs are free and regularly updated, and so offer increased security to users regardless of their resources. It's also fundamental to have updated Anti-Virus and Anti-Spyware programs like [*Avast!*](avast/windows) or [*Spybot*](spybot/windows). 


{{ snippet: ./002-snippet_06.md }}

However, it's not just about software. We also have to be on the lookout for suspicious mails and keep the following points in mind:

* If you receive an unexpected or suspicious mail, **always verify with your contact whether they actually sent the mail**.
* **Never open or download a suspicious attachment** unless you have verified that it is legitimate.
* **Check the actual destination of links** by hovering over them with your cursor.
* NEVER send your e-mail or other account password to anyone.
* NEVER enter your e-mail or other account password on any login page which appears after following a link in an email.
* ALWAYS **ensure that you are on the legitimate login page** of your email or other account by checking the URL carefully at the top of the screen.

# Monitoring and Tracking 
**The problem:**

A large number of activities we used to conduct offline have now been moved online. Such examples include banking, shoping, surveys and tests, socialising and sharing ideas. Both personal and seemingly random data that are continuously required by governments (biometric registration), mobile phone companies, company databases, 'random surveys', gaming comapnies and mobile apps have been confirmed by the Snowden leaks in 2013 to be tools used by companies and governments to gather data *en masse* about us, which can lead to targeted surveillance and attacks.

The aggregation and analysis of data related to our use of services have made it possible to predict our traits and attributes. In 2013, Michal Kosinski [developed](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/06/1218772110) a mathematical tool that can predict an individual's traits like age, sex, sexual orientation, religion and political leanings using their Facebook 'likes' alone. With such tools being available to businesses and governments alike, it is easy to see the possibility of abuse and targeting of LGBTI groups and persons especially in countries where such activities are criminalised. The various services that can be used to build a profile of our interests, habits and characteristics, include our social network accounts, online banking, online commerce, and smartphone apps. 

Furthermore, the rapidly-growing surveillance industry is continuously making remote intrusion and surveillance products available to States. Nigeria and Ethiopia are among the first in Africa that have been [exposed](https://citizenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/SUN_NOON_WORLD1.jpg) for purchasing and using these tools.

**Staying safe:**

A helpful rule of thumb is to **share identifying data on social platforms only on a need-to-know basis**. However, some information is created and communicated by our very use of the Internet, which can include our browsing history or even our location information. To avoid this, we must consider using software which helps to anonymise our online activities, such as the [*Tor Browser*](torbrowser/windows), or even [**Tails**](https://tails.boum.org) which is an easy-to-use bootable operating system which you can run from a flash drive.
