***Elena:*** I know backup is important, Nikolai, but doesn't that mean I should have someone else set it up for me? I mean, am I really going to have the time, resources and expertise to do this on my own?

***Nikolai:*** You'll be fine. Coming up with a good backup plan takes a bit of thought, but it doesn't take all that much time or money. And, compared with losing all of your information, you can hardly call it inconvenient, right? Besides, backup is definitely one of those things that you should manage yourself. Unless the people who normally help you out with tech support are extremely reliable and extremely well-informed about where you keep your digital information, you're better off setting things up on your own.
