***Pablo***: I had a colleague once who received an email from me that I didn't send. We decided, in the end, that it was just spam, but now I'm imagining how much damage could be done if a fake email appeared in the wrong person's inbox at the wrong time. I've heard you can prevent this kind of thing with digital signatures, but what are they?
			
***Claudia***: A digital signature is like a wax seal over the flap of an envelope with your letter inside, except that it can't be forged. It proves that you are the real sender of the message and that it hasn't been tampered with along the way.
