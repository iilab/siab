***Pablo:*** So, should I switch to using RiseUp or I can keep using Gmail, and just switch to the secure 'https' address?

***Claudia:*** It's your call, but there are a few things you should definitely consider when choosing an email provider. First, do they offer a secure connection to your account? Gmail does, so you're OK there. Second, do you trust the administrators to keep your email private and not to read through it or share it with others? That one's up to you. And, finally, you need to think about whether or not it's acceptable for you to be identified with that provider. In other words, will it get you in trouble to use an email address that ends in 'riseup.net', which is known to be popular among activists, or do you need a more typical 'gmail.com' address?
