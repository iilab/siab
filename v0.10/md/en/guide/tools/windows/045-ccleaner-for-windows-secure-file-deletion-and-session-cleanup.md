title: CCleaner for Windows - secure file deletion and session cleanup

---

**CCleaner** is an easy-to-use and efficient program, essential to protecting your digital privacy and security. By permanently deleting (or *wiping*) your browser history, cookies, other temporary files created during your work session, as well as free disk space, **CCleaner** limits the ways in which hostile or malicious parties can monitor your work habits and preferences or infect your system.

# 1. Introduction to CCleaner





## 1.0 Other tools like CCleaner

Aother excellent temporary file removal and shredder tool compatible with **GNU Linux** and **Microsoft Windows** is [**BleachBit**](http://bleachbit.sourceforge.net/). **BleachBit** lets you wipe temporary files in 70 of the most popular applications, operating system temporary files and free hard disk space. An open-source program with a portable version, **BleachBit** is available in 32 languages.

**CCleaner** is also available for **Mac OS**, but users will appreciate free tools from [**Titaniumâ€™s Software**, **OnyX** and **Maintenance**](http://www.titanium.free.fr/) to erase traces of your work session. 

To securely wipe your *Trash*, open the *Finder* menu and then **select** *Finder > Secure Empty Trash...*. To always securely wipe your *Trash*, **select** *Finder > Preferences* and then **click** the *Advanced* tab. Next, **check** the *Empty Trash securely* option. To wipe free space on the disk, **run** the *Disk Utility* system application, **select** the disk partition, **choose** *Erase* tab, and then **click** the *Erase Free Space..* button. 


## 1.1 Things you should know about CCleaner before you start

The default settings on your computer system or an Internet browser automatically collect and create a data trail that a knowledgeable hostile or malicious party can follow. Every time you use an Internet browser or word processor, or program, temporary data and files are generated and stored on your computer system. It could also generate lists of recently viewed documents or web pages. For example, whenever you type a web address into your Internet browser, a list of those addresses beginning with that/those letter(s) may be displayed as follows:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-00.png)

*Figure 1: An Internet browser address bar displaying different URLs.*

Although browser histories may be convenient, they also let someone identify the web sites you have visited. Moreover, your recent activities may be exposed by temporary data collected from images that appear on those web sites, including email messages or information typed into Internet forms. 

To remove temporary data created every time you use a program, you would have to open each individual program directory, identify and then manually delete its temporary program files from there. **CCleaner** simply displays a list of programs and lets you choose the program(s) from which all temporary files should be deleted. 

**Important**: Although **CCleaner** only erases temporary files, and not the actual documents saved on your computer, it is **strongly recommended** that you keep an up-to-date backup of your documents (please refer to the **How-to Booklet** chapter [**How to Recover from Information Loss**](../backup) for more information on how to perform a backup). 

After running **CCleaner** you may lose your all browser and recent document histories, and saved passwords. However, this is *precisely* the point of this tool - to minimize the different ways of infecting or monitoring your computer system.

# 2. Install and Configure CCleaner

As described in detail in the **How-to Booklet** chapter [**How to Destroy Sensitive Information**](../destroy-sensitive-information), the **Microsoft Windows** standard file deletion methods do not erase the actual data from the disk (even when you have emptied the *Recycle Bin*). This also applies to temporary files. To delete them permanently (that is, to *wipe* them) from the hard disk, the files must be overwritten with random data. **CCleaner** must be configured to overwrite any deleted files in order to securely delete them, as it will not do so in default mode. **CCleaner** can also securely delete old information by wiping any free disk space  (please refer to section **How to Wipe Free Disk Space Using CCleaner**).

## 2.1 Install CCleaner

## 2.2 Configure CCleaner

Before you begin using **CCleaner**, it should be configured to securely delete all temporary files. 

To configure **CCleaner**, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. Either **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-13.png) or **select Start > Programs > CCleaner** to activate the *Piriform CCleaner* console.

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-14.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-15.png)

*Figure 6: The Options tab displaying the default About pane*

**Step 3**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-16.png) to activate the *Settings* pane. The *Settings* pane lets you choose the language you are most comfortable working in, and determine how **CCleaner** will delete temporary files and wipe drives. 

**Note**: The *Secure Deletion* section appears with the *Normal file deletion* option enabled. 

**Step 4**. **Click** the *Secure file deletion (Slower)* option to enable the drop-down list. 

**Step 5**. **Expand** the *Secure file deletion (Slower)* drop-down list and **select** the *Advanced Overwrite (3 passes)* item to resemble the following screen: 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-17.png)

*Figure 5: The Settings pane displaying the Secure Deletion options*

After you have set this option, **CCleaner** will overwrite the files and folders you have selected for deletion with random data, effectively wiping them from your hard disk. The *passes* in the *Secure deletion* drop-down list, refer to the number of times your data will be overwritten by random data. The greater the number of passes selected, the more times your document, file or folder will be overwritten with random data. This reduces the recoverability of that document, file or folder, but increases the length of time required by the wiping process.  


# 3. Delete temporary files

In this section, we will learn how to delete all the temporary files
created by **Microsoft Windows** and most applications that you use on your computer.

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-13.png) or **select  Start > Programs > CCleaner** to activate the **CCleaner** console. 

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-18.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-19.png) 

*Figure 1: The CCleaner console displaying the Cleaner pane*

The *Cleaner* window is divided into two panes, the left pane displaying the *Windows* and *Application* tabs, and the right pane featuring an empty space to display information or results from a given cleaning operation. The *Analyze* and *Run Cleaner* buttons are located beneath that space.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-20.png) 

*Figure 2: The Windows and Applications tabs with all options checked*

**Note**: By using the following steps, you will delete temporary files for the items you have checked in both the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs. Given that different users have different programs installed on their computer, your own list of applications may vary somewhat from the example in *Figure 2* above.

**Step 3**. **Scroll** down the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs and **check** all the options in the *Advanced* section too. As you check some of the options, a warning confirmation dialog box appears, explaining what each option will affect:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-21.png)

*Figure 3: An example of a Warning confirmation dialog box*

**Warning**: By checking the *Wipe Free Space* option, you will significantly increase the amount of time required for the cleaning process; as such, ensure you have at least an hour or more for this. 

**Note**: **Check** all the options in the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs to enable a full and thorough cleaning of the temporary files. However, it is essential that you understand what kind of configurations and settings are being deleted. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-22.png) to close each message and continue with the temporary file deletion process.

**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-23.png) to generate and view a list of the different temporary files available for deletion.

**Tip**: Close all other programs before you begin the cleaning process. If you leave them open, **CCleaner** may not remove all the temporary files associated with those programs, and you may receive pop-up notices resembling *Figure 4* below.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-24.png)

*Figure 4: An example of a notice to close Firefox/Mozilla* 

**Step 5**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-25.png) to continue listing the files for deletion.

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-26.png)

*Figure 5: An example of a list of temporary files for deletion*

**Note**: **CCleaner** only deletes the temporary files generated whenever you use an application â€“ and *not* the application itself. In *Figure 5* for example, the *Applications â€“ Office 2003* program suite remains installed on the computer, but its temporary files have been deleted. However, to use **CCleaner** to uninstall a program, please refer to **Advanced Options, FAQ and Review**, section **5.1 How to Uninstall Programs Using CCleaner**.

**Step 6**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-27.png) activate the following screen: 

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-28.png)

*Figure 6: Permanent file deletion confirmation prompt*

**Step 7**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-22.png) to delete these temporary files as follows; after the deletion has been completed, the results displayed may resemble the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-29.png)

*Figure 7: The file deletion results*

You have now successfully deleted your temporary files from both the *Windows* and *Applications* tabs using **CCleaner**.


# 4. Clean the Windows Registry

**CCleaner** also lets you clean the **Windows Registry**, a database which stores configuration information, hardware and software settings on your system. Every time you alter system configuration information, install software or perform other routine tasks, these changes are reflected and stored in the **Windows Registry**. 

Over time, however, the **Windows Registry** accumulates outdated configuration information and settings, including traces of obsolete programs. The **CCleaner** *Registry* option lets you scan and remove such information, improving the overall function and speed of your system, as well as protecting your digital privacy and security.  

**Tip**: A scan of the **Windows Registry** should be performed on a weekly or monthly basis.

# 5. Advanced features of CCleaner

**CCleaner's** *Uninstall* and *Startup* features could improve the overall efficiency of your system. They are described below, along with the steps required to permanently delete (or *wipe*) free space on a specified drive.

## 5.1 How to Uninstall Programs Using CCleaner

**Important**: Make sure the program to be deleted or uninstalled is not essential to the proper functioning of your computer system before you begin doing so.

By deleting unused or unwanted previously installed software before running **CCleaner**, you may also remove their temporary files and folders. This may reduce the number of temporary files and folders to be deleted, as well as the length of time for the cleaning process.  

The **CCleaner** *Uninstall* feature is the equivalent of the **Uninstall a program** feature found in **Control Panel**. The *Uninstall* feature lists the programs more clearly and quickly.

To begin uninstalling obsolete programs, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. Either **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-13.png) or **select Start > Programs > CCleaner** to activate the *Piriform CCleaner* console.

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-50.png) and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-51.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-52.png)

*Figure 1: The Tools option displaying the Uninstall pane*

**Note**: The buttons on the right of the *Programs to Remove* list are only enabled after a program has been selected for removal.

**Step 3**. **Select** a program from the *Programs to Remove* list, and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-53.png) to uninstall the selected program.

**Tip**: Advanced or experienced users will find the *Rename* and *Delete* features useful in keeping the existence of certain software private. Either feature ensures only you know about the existence of this program, keeping it safe from hostile or malicious parties which may list installed programs.

**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-54.png) to rename that program. Alternatively, **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-55.png) to delete a program from that list, but *without* actually uninstalling it.

## 5.2 How to Disable Auto-Start Programs in CCleaner

An auto-start program is configured to automatically start itself whenever you turn your computer on. Auto-start programs may start making demands on finite system resources, and slow down your computer at start-up time. 

**Step 2**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-50.png) and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-56.png) to activate the following screen:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-57.png)

**Step 3**. **Select** a program from those listed in the *Startup* pane and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-58.png) to disable the program so it does not automatically start running when you turn on your computer. 

<a name="5.3"></a>

## 5.3 How to Wipe Free Disk Space Using CCleaner

In the **Windows** operating system, deleting a file merely removes a reference to that file, but may not remove its actual data. Although the area of that drive will eventually be overwritten with new files over time, a knowledgeable individual could rebuild either all or sections of that file. However, you can prevent this from happening by wiping the free space on your hard disk. **CCleaner** also lets you wipe the **Master File Table**.

The **Master File Table (MFT)** is an index of all file names, their locations, and other information. When **Microsoft Windows** deletes a file it only marks the index entry for that file as deleted for reasons of efficiency. The **MFT** entry for the file and the content of the file continue to reside on the hard disk.

**Note**: Performing a disk and **Master File Table** wipe consumes a considerable amount of time, and the amount of time required depends on the number of passes set.

To set the drive you would like to wipe, perform the following steps:

**Step 1**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-61.png) and then **click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-62.png) to activate the *Drive Wiper* pane. 

**Step 2**. **Click** the *Wipe* ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-04.png) to activate its drop-down list, and then **select**  either the *Free Space* or the *Entire drive (All data will be erased)* item, and then **select** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-59.png) from the *Security* drop-down list.

**Warning**: Only select the *Entire drive (All data will be erased)* item if you are *completely* certain that you want your documents, files and folders *and* free space erased.

**Step 3**. **Click** the check box associated with the drive to be erased, and enable the ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-64.png); your window should now resemble the following:

![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-65.png)

*Figure 3: The Drive Wiper pane with the relevant options enabled*

**Step 4**. **Click** ![](/sites/siabnext.ttc.io/files/media/ccleaner-win-64.png) to begin wiping your selected drive(s).


# 6. Portable CCleaner





## 6.1 Differences between the Installed and Portable versions of CCleaner

Given that portable tools are *not* installed on a local computer, their existence and use may remain undetected. However, keep in mind that your external device or USB memory stick, and portable tools are only as safe as the computer you are using, and may risk being exposed to adware, malware, spyware and viruses. 

There are no other differences between **Portable CCleaner**, and this version can be installed on a local computer as well.
