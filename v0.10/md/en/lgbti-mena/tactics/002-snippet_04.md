The incident of [**hacking the Tunisian Gayday magazine**](http://www.passagenlevant.blogspot.de/2012/03/tunisias-gayday-magazine-hacked.html) has probably been the most resonant online attack on LGBT individuals in recent years. In 2012, a group of malicious hackers managed not only to break into and deface the magazine's website, but also gained access to the Twitter and the e-mail accounts associated with it. They reportedly replaced “Gayday magazine” with “GarbageDayMagazine” as a clear homophobic statement. The founder and editor of the magazine claimed that the emails did not contain any sensitive or personal information. However, he stated in response to the attacks that, “We call upon activists not to panic because of such incident and to keep their continuous fight. Serious security measures need to be performed to protect online movement.”
