In January 2013, a lone hacker, Shahin Ramezany, was able to exploit a hole in Yahoo’s servers by leveraging a vulnerability – described as DOM-based XSS vulnerability – that is exploitable in all major browsers thus putting more than 400 million yahoo accounts at risk. As recently as April 2014, Yahoo mail was still being attacked due to similar vulnerabilities. – Emil Protalinski, TheNextWeb.
