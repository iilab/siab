title: Protect your evidence

---

Environmental Rights defenders depend on evidence gathered from sites of ecological and community violations to advocate for favourable public opinion, policy change and government action against these offences. As a result, the security and integrity of evidence is of utmost importance.

Evidence such as interviews, photos, videos and documents stored in computers, phones and other devices can be compromised, stolen or destroyed by adversaries who want to disrupt the work and destroy the credibility of ERDs, if such evidence remains unsecured. Inside informants can also be exposed and action taken against them.



# Protecting evidence files stored in your computer
You should consider all evidence collected and saved in your computer or phone as sensitive information. As such, you should always protect this information and make it impossible for it to be used against you, your partners or your informers. Security in-a-box has several guides that can show you how to protect your information. Specifically, you should read and understand these three guides:

- [How to protect the sensitive files in your computer](secure-file-storage), which explains how you can encrypt and hide your sensitive information.
- [How to recover from information loss](backup), which explains how to backup your information and how you can recover your files from accidental deletion
- [How to destroy sensitive information](destroy-sensitive-information), which deals with completely obliterate files stored in your computer in case you no longer need them.
