However, as <strong>YouTube</strong> is owned by <strong>Google</strong>, if the people at <strong>Google</strong> find the content of your video objectionable, they will delete it. Google may collect and share user metadata <em>en masse</em> and share it with goverments including the United States government. Furthermore, Google may share specific information related to your videos (such as, for example, location data) to third parties including State bodies who request it. This means <strong>YouTube</strong> is not such a good place for keeping your video safe. <strong>Google</strong> have also been known to cave in to pressure to remove content from <strong>YouTube</strong> in order to avoid the site being censored. So if you want people to see your video, put a copy of it on <strong>YouTube</strong> \u2013 just don't put your only copy on <strong>YouTube</strong> for safe storage.</p>\n\n<p>The content you post on <strong>YouTube</strong> remains yours; by posting it on <strong>YouTube</strong> you are giving <strong>Google</strong> a license to distribute that content.</p>\n\n<p><strong>YouTube</strong> is or has been reported as inaccessible in various countries, like:</p>\n\n<ul><li>China </li>\n<li>Burma </li>\n<li>Iran </li>\n<li>Libya</li>\n<li>Syria </li>\n<li>Uzbekistan</li>\n<li>Tunisia</li>\n<li>Turkmenistan, and</li>\n<li>Turkey.</li>\n</ul><p>See <a href=\"https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/\"><strong>Google's traffic section in their Transparency Report</strong></a> for more details about current and past censorship and other disruptions.</p>\n\n<h3>YouTube Tips:</h3>\n\n<ul><li><p>Never post a video of any individual without their consent. And even with their consent, try to think of any possible repercussions before posting it.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you navigate to <strong>YouTube</strong>, do so by typing http<strong>s</strong>://www.youtube.com into your browser's address bar - this will ensure that the communication between your computer and <strong>YouTube</strong>'s servers will be encrypted by a <strong>Secure Socket Layer</strong> (SSL) connection. To avoid having to do this each time you connect, we reccommend connecting to <strong>YouTube</strong> using <a href=\"/en/firefox_main\"><strong>Firefox</strong></a> with add-ons such as <a href=\"/en/firefox_others#5.5\"><strong>HTTPS Everywhere</strong></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>For more privacy, try creating a new, anonymised <strong>Google</strong> account which is created and only accessed while using the <a href=\"/en/tor_main\"><strong>Tor Browser</strong></a>. Use only this account for uploading videos to <strong>YouTube</strong> and your location and other identifying data will be hidden from <strong>Google</strong> and others such as your Internet Service Provider. However, it is often impossible to view videos on <strong>YouTube</strong> using the <strong>Tor Browser</strong>. For viewing videos, it may be best to create another account and use a browser such as <a href=\"/en/firefox_main\"><strong>Firefox with Add-ons</strong></a></p></li>\n<li><p>For uploading sensitive videos from an <a href=\"/en/glossary#Android\">Android</a> device, consider using the <a href=\"/en/glossary#guardian_project\">Guardian Project</a>'s <a href=\"https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav\">CameraV</a> app and <a href=\"https://storymaker.cc/\">Story maker</a> app , which allows users a certain amound of control over their videos' metadata and facilitates uploading over the Tor network when used in conjunction with <a href=\"/en/orbot_main\"><strong>Orbot</strong></a>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make use of <strong>YouTube</strong>'s <strong>face-blurring</strong> option for videos in which people may not wish to be identified, such as protests. Read more <a href=\"http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;guide=1388381&amp;page=guide.cs&amp;answer=2640535\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p></li>\n</ul><p>-Think carefully before you post personal information. This includes things like the town you live in, where you go to school, or your home address.</p>\n\n<ul><li><p>Always keep a back-up copy of any video you share via <strong>YouTube</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Use the <em>private</em> setting in order to share video with specific individuals only.</p></li>\n</ul><h3>Alternatives to YouTube</h3>\n\n<p>If you do not wish to associate your videos with your <strong>Google profile</strong>, there are a number of alternatives, such as <a href=\"https://www.vimeo.com\"><strong>Vimeo</strong></a>. Vimeo is frequented by a smaller community of users than <strong>YouTube</strong>. Like <strong>YouTube</strong>, it facilitates connection over <strong>SSL</strong>, and gives users numerous privacy options and control of creative commons licenses for their videos. Other similar sites may be popular in different regions, so you way wish to explore other options. Before choosing one you should consider the following points:</p>\n\n<ol><li>Does it provide connection over <strong>SSL</strong> for all uses of the site, rather than just during login? Are there no problems related to encryption, such as problems related to encryption certificates?</li>\n<li>Read the End User Licence Agreement and Privacy Policy or Data Use Policy carefully. How are your content and personal data treated? With whom are they shared?</li>\n<li>What privacy options are provided for users? Can you choose to share your videos securely with a small number of individuals, or are they all public by default? </li>\n<li>If you will upload sensitive images, such as footage of a protest, does the site facilitate protection of those you have filmed, such as through face-blurring?</li>\n<li>Do you know the <strong>geographical location of the servers</strong>, under which territorial jurisdiction they fall or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information? Will the site's owners hand over information if they receive a governmental request to do so?</li>\n</ol>",

This means **YouTube** is not such a good place for keeping your video safe. **Google** have also been known to cave in to pressure to remove content from **YouTube** in order to avoid the site being censored. So if you want people to see your video, put a copy of it on **YouTube** \u2013 just don't put your only copy on **YouTube** for safe storage.\r\n\r\nThe content you post on **YouTube** remains yours; by posting it on **YouTube** you are giving **Google** a license to distribute that content.\r\n\r\n**YouTube** is or has been reported as inaccessible in various countries, like:\r\n\r\n*  China \r\n*  Burma \r\n*  Iran \r\n*  Libya\r\n*  Syria \r\n*  Uzbekistan\r\n*  Tunisia\r\n*  Turkmenistan, and\r\n*  Turkey.\r\n\r\nSee [**Google's traffic section in their Transparency Report**](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/traffic/) for more details about current and past censorship and other disruptions.\r\n\r\n### YouTube Tips: ###\r\n\r\n- Never post a video of any individual without their consent. And even with their consent, try to think of any possible repercussions before posting it.\r\n\r\n- When you navigate to **YouTube**, do so by typing http**s**://www.youtube.com into your browser's address bar - this will ensure that the communication between your computer and **YouTube**'s servers will be encrypted by a **Secure Socket Layer** (SSL) connection. To avoid having to do this each time you connect, we reccommend connecting to **YouTube** using [**Firefox**](/en/firefox_main) with add-ons such as [**HTTPS Everywhere**](/en/firefox_others#5.5).\r\n\r\n- For more privacy, try creating a new, anonymised **Google** account which is created and only accessed while using the [**Tor Browser**](/en/tor_main). Use only this account for uploading videos to **YouTube** and your location and other identifying data will be hidden from **Google** and others such as your Internet Service Provider. However, it is often impossible to view videos on **YouTube** using the **Tor Browser**. For viewing videos, it may be best to create another account and use a browser such as [**Firefox with Add-ons**](/en/firefox_main)\r\n\r\n- For uploading sensitive videos from an [Android](/en/glossary#Android) device, consider using the [Guardian Project](/en/glossary#guardian_project)'s [CameraV](https://guardianproject.info/apps/camerav) app and [Story maker](https://storymaker.cc/) app , which allows users a certain amound of control over their videos' metadata and facilitates uploading over the Tor network when used in conjunction with [**Orbot**](/en/orbot_main).\r\n\r\n- Make use of **YouTube**'s **face-blurring** option for videos in which people may not wish to be identified, such as protests. Read more [**here**](http://support.google.com/youtube/bin/static.py?hl=en&guide=1388381&page=guide.cs&answer=2640535).\r\n\r\n-Think carefully before you post personal information. This includes things like the town you live in, where you go to school, or your home address.\r\n\r\n- Always keep a back-up copy of any video you share via **YouTube**.\r\n\r\n- Use the *private* setting in order to share video with specific individuals only.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives to YouTube ### \r\n\r\nIf you do not wish to associate your videos with your **Google profile**, there are a number of alternatives, such as [**Vimeo**](https://www.vimeo.com). Vimeo is frequented by a smaller community of users than **YouTube**. Like **YouTube**, it facilitates connection over **SSL**, and gives users numerous privacy options and control of creative commons licenses for their videos. Other similar sites may be popular in different regions, so you way wish to explore other options. Before choosing one you should consider the following points:\r\n\r\n1. Does it provide connection over **SSL** for all uses of the site, rather than just during login? Are there no problems related to encryption, such as problems related to encryption certificates?\r\n2. Read the End User Licence Agreement and Privacy Policy or Data Use Policy carefully. How are your content and personal data treated? With whom are they shared?\r\n3. What privacy options are provided for users? Can you choose to share your videos securely with a small number of individuals, or are they all public by default? \r\n4. If you will upload sensitive images, such as footage of a protest, does the site facilitate protection of those you have filmed, such as through face-blurring?\r\n4. Do you know the **geographical location of the servers**, under which territorial jurisdiction they fall or where the company is registered? Are you aware of how this information relates to the privacy and security of your email activity and information? Will the site's owners hand over information if they receive a governmental request to do so?\r\n\r\n"

This would mean that, in the case of sensitive images, they could easily fall into the wrong hands. In order for only you to decide how the images are shared, it is reccommended that you disable this option.
