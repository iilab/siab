Examples might include paper letters, faxes, landline phones, mobile phones, emails and [*Skype*](/en/glossary#Skype) messages.\r\n\r\n- Consider how you store important information. Computer hard drives, email and web servers, USB memory sticks, external USB hard drives, CDs and DVDs, mobile phones, printed paper and hand-written\tnotes are all likely possibilities.\r\n\r\n- Consider where these items are located, physically. They could be in the office, at home, in a trash bin out back or, increasingly, 'somewhere on the Internet.' In this last case, it might be quite challenging to to determine the particular piece of information's actual, physical location.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the same piece of information might be vulnerable on many different levels. Just as you might rely on anti-virus software to protect the contents of a USB memory stick from [*malware*](/en/glossary#Malware), you must rely on a detailed physical security plan to protect the same information from theft, loss or destruction. While some security practices, such as having a good off-site backup policy, are helpful against both digital and physical threats, others are clearly more specific.\r\n\r\nWhen you decide whether to carry your USB memory stick in your pocket or sealed in a plastic bag at the bottom of your luggage, you are making a decision about physical security, even though the information you are trying to protect is digital. As usual, the correct policy depends greatly on the situation. Are you walking across town or travelling across a border? Will somebody else be carrying your bag? Is it raining? These are the sorts of questions that you should consider when making decisions like this. \r\n"
